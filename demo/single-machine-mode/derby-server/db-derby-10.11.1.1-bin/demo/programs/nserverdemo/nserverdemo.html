<H2><A name=Top_Of_Page></A><A name=nsrun></A><A name=nssample></A>Derby 
Network Server sample program</H2>
<P>The Network Server sample demo program (NsSample) is a simple JDBC application that 
interacts with the Derby Network Server. The program:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Starts the Derby Network Server.</LI>
  <LI>Connects to the Network Server and creates the database if not already
  created. The Network Client driver is loaded automatically.</LI>
  <LI>Checks to see if the schema is already created, and if not, </LI>
  <LI>Creates the schema, which includes the <tt>SAMPLETBL</tt> table and 
  corresponding indexes.</LI>
  <LI>Connects to the database.</LI>
  <LI>Loads the schema by inserting data.</LI>
  <LI>Starts client threads to perform database related operations.</LI>
  <LI>Has each of the clients perform DML operations (select, insert, delete, 
  update) using JDBC calls; in particular, one client opens an embedded
  connection to perform database operations, while the other client opens a
  client connection to the Derby Network Server to perform database
  operations.</LI> 
  <LI>Waits for the client threads to finish the tasks.</LI>
  <LI>Shuts down the Derby Network Server at the end of the demo.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The following files in the
<TT><i>DERBY_INSTALL</i>\demo\programs\nserverdemo\</TT> directory are needed to
run the sample program (<i>DERBY_INSTALL</i> is the directory where you
installed Derby):</P>
<UL>
  <LI><TT>NsSample.java</tt><br>
This is the entry point into the demo application. The program starts up two clients. One client opens an embedded 
connection to perform database operations, while the other client opens a client 
connection to the Derby Network Server to perform database operations.  This program provides the following constants that 
can be changed to modify the sample demo:
<UL>

    <LI><tt>NUM_ROWS</tt> - The number of rows that must be initially loaded into the schema.</li>
    <LI><tt>ITERATIONS</tt> - The number of iterations for which each client thread does database related work.</LI>
<LI><tt>NUM_CLIENT_THREADS</tt> - The number of clients that you want to run the program against.</li> 
    <LI><tt>NETWORKSERVER_PORT</tt> - The port on which the network server is running.</LI>
</UL>

You can also modify the program to exclude starting the Network Server as part of the sample program. 
Make sure to recompile the Java files before running the program if you make any 
changes to the source code.

</li>

<li><tt>NsSampleClientThread.java</tt></br>
This file contains two Java classes:
  <UL>
    <LI>The <tt>NsSampleClientThread</tt> class extends Thread and does all the 
necessary work by instantiating a <tt>NsSampleWork</tt> instance.</li>
    <LI>The <tt>NsSampleWork</tt> class contains everything required to perform 
DML operations using JDBC calls. The <tt>doWork</tt> method in 
the <tt>NsSampleWork</tt> class represents all the work done as 
part of this sample program.</LI>
</UL>
</li>
  <LI><tt>NetworkServerUtil.java</tt><br>
This file contains helper methods to start the Derby Network Server and to shut down the server.
</li>
  <LI>Compiled class files:
<UL>
    <LI><tt>NsSample.class</tt></li> 
    <LI><tt>NsSampleClientThread.class</tt></li> 
    <LI><tt>NetworkServerUtil.class</tt></li> 
</UL>
</li>
</ul>


<H2>Running the Network Server demo program</H2>
<P>To run the Derby Network Server demonstration program:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Open a command prompt and change directories to the <tt><i>DERBY_INSTALL</i>\demo\programs\</tt> directory. 
  <LI>Set the CLASSPATH to the current directory (".") and also include the following 
  jar files in order to use the Derby Network Server and the Derby Client Network JDBC Driver.
<ul>
<li><tt>derbynet.jar</tt><br>The Network Server jar file. It must be in your CLASSPATH to use any of the Derby Network 
Server functions.</li>
<li><tt>derbyclient.jar</tt><br>This jar file must be in your CLASSPATH to use the Derby Client Network JDBC Driver.</li>
<li><tt>derby.jar</tt><br>The Derby database engine jar file.</li>
</ul>
</LI>
<li>Test the CLASSPATH settings by running the following java command:<pre>java org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo</pre>This command will show the Derby jar files that are in the CLASSPATH along with their respective versions.</li>
<li>Once you have set up your environment correctly, execute the application from the <br> 
<tt><i>DERBY_INSTALL</i>\demo\programs\</tt> directory:<br>
<pre>java nserverdemo.NsSample [driverType]</pre>
<ul>
<li>Where the possible values for driverType are:
<ul>
<li>derbyClient (default)
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
</OL>
You should receive output similar to the following if the 
program runs successfully:<br><br>
