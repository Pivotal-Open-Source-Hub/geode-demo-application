<h1 class="Title">Scores Demo</h1>
<p>The <code><i>DERBY_HOME</i>/demo/programs/scores</code> directory contains a
demo application which shows how you can run user-written Java code inside the
Derby database.</p>
<p>To see the Ant targets that enable you to build and run the demo application,
cd to this directory and type the following command:</p>
<pre>
   ant -projecthelp
</pre>
<p>Follow the instructions in the command output. You may need to download the
Jakarta Commons Math library from the Apache web site. After customizing a
property, you will use the <code>ant run</code> command to run the
application.</p>
<p>The demo shows you how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declare Java functions and procedures and run them inside the Derby
   engine</li>
<li>Load the Derby engine with jar files of user-written code</li>
<li>Enforce data consistency by wiring functions into CREATE TABLE
   statements</li>
<li>Run a Java procedure from a TRIGGER</li>
<li>Improve query performance by wiring filtering functions into the
   WHERE clause</li>
<li>Format query output by wiring functions into the SELECT list</li>
<li>Re-use off-the-shelf packages to write your own custom data aggregator</li>
</ul>
<p>For more detail, please consult the following sections of the <i>Derby
Developer's Guide</i>:</p>

<li>"Loading classes from a database"</li>
<li>"Derby server-side programming"</li>
</ul>
