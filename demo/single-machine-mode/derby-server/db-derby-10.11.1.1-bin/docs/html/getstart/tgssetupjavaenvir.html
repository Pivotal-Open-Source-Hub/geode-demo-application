<h1 class="topictitle1">Setting the environment variables</h1>



<div><p>There are several environment variables that must be set depending
on the method that you selected to run the <span>Derby</span> tools
and startup utilities.</p>

<div class="section">As mentioned in <a href="tgsruntoolsutils.html#tgsruntoolsutils">choosing
a method to run the Derby tools and startup utilities</a>, you must set
the <span>DERBY_HOME</span> environment
variable so that you can use the command examples
that are presented in this manual.  Adding the <span>Derby</span> scripts
directory to your command execution PATH makes the scripts easier to use and
enables you to use the script examples in this manual.  The CLASSPATH environment
variable must be set if you are using <span>Derby</span> in
a Java program or executing the tools using the <samp class="codeph">java</samp> command.<div class="p">The
steps below show you how to set the environment variables in a command window.
The settings are only valid for that window. If you close the command window
or open a new command window, you must set the environment variables again.<div class="tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip: </span> You can also set environment variables permanently. For example,
on Windows you can use the Control Panel to permanently set the environment
variables.</div>
</div>
<p>To set the environment variables:</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Set the <span>DERBY_HOME</span> environment
variable to the location where you extracted the <span>Derby</span> <em> bin</em> distribution.</span>
 For example, if you installed <span>Derby</span> in
the <samp class="codeph">/opt/<span>Derby_10</span></samp> directory
on UNIX or in the <samp class="codeph">c:\<span>Derby_10</span></samp> directory
on Windows, use one of the commands in the following table to set the
<span>DERBY_HOME</span> environment
variable.

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Add the <samp class="codeph"><span>DERBY_HOME</span>/bin</samp> directory

from any directory, as shown in the following table.</span>

<div class="tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip: </span>When the <span>DERBY_HOME</span> environment
variable is set and the underlying <samp class="codeph">/bin</samp> directory is included
in the PATH environment variable, you can use shortened commands to start
the <span>Derby</span> tools. Otherwise,
either you must be in the directory where the script that starts the <span>Derby</span> tool
is located, or you must specify the full path to the location of the script
when you want to start the tool.</div>
