<div><p>This section is for experienced JDBC programmers who already know
how to set the classpath, how to run a Java program, and how to use a JDBC
driver.</p>

<p>For more detailed information on the topics covered in this section, see
the <cite><span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span></cite> and the <cite><span><em>Derby Tools and Utilities Guide</em></span></cite>. See
<a href="rgsdocs17307.html#rgsdocs17307">Product documentation for Derby</a> for an overview of the
<span>Derby</span> documentation.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cgsquck70629.html">Environments in which Derby can run</a></strong><br />
Before you configure your system to run Derby, it is useful to understand something about the different environments in which Derby can run, because these environments affect the classpath, driver name, and database connection URL.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rgsquck35368.html">Available drivers</a></strong><br />
Different JDBC drivers are available depending on the environment you choose for Derby.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rgsquck30197.html">Database connection URL</a></strong><br />
You must use a database connection URL when using the Derby-provided embedded driver to connect to a database.</li>
