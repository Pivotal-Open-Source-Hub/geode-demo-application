<h1 class="topictitle1">Deployment options</h1>


<div><p>The <span>Derby</span> software
distribution provides two basic deployment options (also referred to as <dfn class="term">frameworks</dfn>),
the simple embedded option and the <span>Derby</span> Network
Server option.</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Embedded</dt>

<dd>Refers to <span>Derby</span> being
started by a simple single-user Java application. With this option <span>Derby</span> runs
in the same Java virtual machine (JVM) as the application.  <span>Derby</span> can
be almost invisible to the end user because it is started and stopped by the
application and often requires no administration.<p>The <span>Derby</span> documentation
often refers to this as the <dfn class="term">embedded configuration</dfn> or <dfn class="term">embedded
mode</dfn>.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Server (or Server-based)</dt>

<dd>Refers to <span>Derby</span> being
started by an application that provides multi-user connectivity to <span>Derby</span> databases
across a network. With this option <span>Derby</span> runs
in the Java virtual machine (JVM) that hosts the Server. Applications connect
to the Server from different JVMs to access the database. The <span>Derby</span> Network
Server is part of the <span>Derby</span> software
distribution and provides this type of framework for <span>Derby</span>.
 <span>Derby</span> also works well
with other, independently developed Server applications. <p>The <span>Derby</span> documentation
often refers to this as the <dfn class="term">Network Server configuration</dfn> or <dfn class="term">client/server
configuration</dfn>.</p>
