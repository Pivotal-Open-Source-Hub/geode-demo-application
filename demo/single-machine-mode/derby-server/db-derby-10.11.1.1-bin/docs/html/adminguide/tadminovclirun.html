<h1 class="topictitle1">Running the SimpleNetworkClientSample program</h1>


<div><p>To connect to the Network Server that has been started with the
<samp class="codeph">SimpleNetworkServerSample</samp> program, follow these
steps.</p>

<ol>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Open a command prompt and change directories to the
<samp class="codeph">%<span>DERBY_HOME</span>%\demo\nserverdemo</samp>
directory, where
<samp class="codeph">%<span>DERBY_HOME</span>%</samp>
is the directory where you installed
<span>Derby</span>.</span>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Set the classpath to include the following jar files:</span>
 <ul>
<li>The current directory (".")</li>

<li><samp class="codeph">derbyclient.jar</samp></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>After you set up your environment correctly, run the
<samp class="codeph">SimpleNetworkClientSample</samp> program from the same
directory:</span>
 
<pre><strong>java SimpleNetworkClientSample</strong></pre>


 If the program runs successfully, you will receive output similar
to that shown in the following example:
<pre>Starting Sample client program
Got a client connection via the DriverManager.
connection from datasource; getDriverName = Apache Derby Network Client JDBC Driver
Got a client connection via a DataSource.
Testing the connection obtained via DriverManager by executing a sample query
number of rows in sys.systables = 23
Testing the connection obtained via a DataSource by executing a sample query
number of rows in sys.systables = 23
Goodbye!</pre>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>After running the program, return to the command prompt where you ran
the <samp class="codeph">SimpleNetworkServerSample</samp> program and press Enter.</span>
</li>

</ol>
