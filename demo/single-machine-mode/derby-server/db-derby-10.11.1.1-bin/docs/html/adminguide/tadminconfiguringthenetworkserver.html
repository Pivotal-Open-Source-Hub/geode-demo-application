<h1 class="topictitle1">Configuring the Network Server to handle connections</h1>



<div><p>You can configure the Network Server to use a specific number of
threads to handle connections. You can change the configuration on the command
line.</p>

<div class="section"><p>The minimum number of threads is the number of threads that are
started when the Network Server is booted. This value is specified as a
property, <samp class="codeph">derby.drda.minThreads=<em>min</em></samp>. The
maximum number of threads is the maximum number of threads that will be used for
connections. If more connections are active than there are threads available,
the extra connections must wait until the next thread becomes available. Threads
can become available after a specified time, which is checked only when a thread
has finished processing a communication.</p>

</div>

<ul>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>You can change the maximum number of threads by using the following
command (all on one line):</span>
 
<pre><strong>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl maxthreads <em>max</em>
  [-h <em>hostname</em>] [-p <em>portnumber</em></strong></pre>


 You can also use the <samp class="codeph">derby.drda.maxThreads</samp> property to
assign the maximum value. A <em>max</em> value of 0 means that there is no maximum
and a new thread will be generated for a connection if there are no current
threads available. This is the default. The <em>max</em> and <em>min</em> values are
stored as integers, so the theoretical maximum is 2147483647 (the maximum size
of an integer). But the practical maximum is determined by the machine
configuration.
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>To change the time that a thread should work on one session's request
and check if there are waiting sessions, use the following command (all on one
line):</span>
 
<pre><strong>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl
  timeslice <em>milliseconds</em> [-h <em>hostname</em>] [-p <em>portnumber</em>]</strong></pre>

 <p>You can also use the <samp class="codeph">derby.drda.timeSlice</samp> property to
set this value. A value of 0 milliseconds indicates that the thread will not
give up working on the session until the session ends. A value of -1
milliseconds indicates to use the default. The default value is 0. The maximum
number of milliseconds that can be specified is 2147483647 (the maximum size of
an integer).</p>
 
</li>

</ul>
