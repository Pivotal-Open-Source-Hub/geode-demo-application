<h1 class="topictitle1">Accessing the Network Server by using a DataSource object</h1>



<div><p>The Network Server supports a set of 
<span>Derby</span> Network
Client driver <samp class="codeph">DataSource</samp> classes.</p>

<p>You can use the <samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDataSource</samp> and
<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientConnectionPoolDataSource</samp> classes
on all supported Java SE versions except Java SE 8 Compact Profile 2. On
Java SE 8 Compact Profile 2, you must use the
<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.jdbc.BasicClientDataSource40</samp> and
<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.jdbc.BasicClientConnectionPoolDataSource40</samp>
classes. For more information, see "JDBC support for Java SE 8 Compact Profiles"
in the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Using statement caching</h2>
<p><span>Derby</span> supports JDBC
statement caching, which can improve the performance of applications that use
<samp class="codeph">PreparedStatement</samp> or <samp class="codeph">CallableStatement</samp>
objects. Statement caching avoids the performance penalty incurred by going over
the network from the client to the server to prepare a statement that has
already been prepared on the same connection.</p>

<p>To use statement caching, you must use an
<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientConnectionPoolDataSource</samp> or
<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.jdbc.BasicClientConnectionPoolDataSource40</samp>
object. After you instantiate this object, perform these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Specify the desired size of your statement cache by calling the
<samp class="codeph">setMaxStatements</samp> method on the <samp class="codeph">DataSource</samp>
object, specifying an argument greater than zero.</li>

<li>Call the <samp class="codeph">getPooledConnection</samp> method on the
<samp class="codeph">DataSource</samp> object to obtain a
<samp class="codeph">javax.sql.PooledConnection</samp> object (a physical
connection).</li>

<li>Call the <samp class="codeph">javax.sql.PooledConnection.getConnection</samp> method
to obtain a <samp class="codeph">java.sql.Connection</samp> object (a logical
connection).</li>

</ol>

<p>After you obtain a connection, use either prepared statements or callable
statements to interact with the database. Close each statement to return it to
the cache after you finish using it. The statements you create are held in the
cache on the client side and reused when needed.</p>

<p>See
<a href="radminnsdatasourcexmp.html#radminnsdatasourcexmp__stmtcacheexmp">Statement caching example</a>
for a code example.</p>

<p>Use of the JDBC statement cache makes each physical connection use more
memory. The amount depends on how many statements the connection is allowed to
cache and how many statements are actually cached.</p>

<p>If you enable JDBC statement caching, error handling changes slightly. Some
errors that previously appeared when the <samp class="codeph">prepareStatement</samp>
method was executed may now appear during statement execution. For example,
suppose you query a table using a prepared statement that is then cached. If the
table is deleted, the prepared statement that queries the table is not
invalidated. If the query is prepared again on the same connection, the cached
object is fetched from the cache, and the <samp class="codeph">prepareStatement</samp> call
seems to have succeeded, although the statement has not actually been prepared.
When the prepared statement is executed, the error is detected on the server
side, and the client is notified.</p>
