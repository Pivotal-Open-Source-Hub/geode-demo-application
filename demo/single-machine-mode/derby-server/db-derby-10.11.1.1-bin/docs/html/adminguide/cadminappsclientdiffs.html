<h1 class="topictitle1">Differences between the embedded client and the network client driver</h1>



<div><p>The following are known differences that exist between the
<span>Derby</span> embedded driver and the
network client driver.</p>

<div class="p">There may be undocumented differences that have not yet been identified. Some
differences with the network client may be changed in future releases to match
the embedded driver functionality.
<ul>
<li>Error messages and <samp class="codeph">SQLState</samp>s can differ between the network
client and embedded driver.</li>

<li>Treatment of error situations encountered during batch processing with
<samp class="codeph">java.sql.Statement</samp>,
<samp class="codeph">java.sql.PreparedStatement</samp>, and
<samp class="codeph">java.sql.CallableStatement</samp> is different. With the embedded
driver, processing stops when an error is encountered; with the network client
driver, processing continues, but an appropriate value as defined in the
<samp class="codeph">java.sql.Statement</samp> API is returned in the resulting update
count array.</li>

<li>To use an encrypted user id and password, you need to have the IBM's Java
Cryptography Extension (JCE) Version 1.2.1 or later.</li>

</ul>
