<h1 class="topictitle1">Multi-connection and multi-threading</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> allows
multiple simultaneous connections to a database, even in embedded mode.
</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> is also fully
multi-threaded, and you can have multiple threads active at the same time.
However, JDBC semantics impose some limitations on multi-threading. See the
<span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span> for more information.</p>
