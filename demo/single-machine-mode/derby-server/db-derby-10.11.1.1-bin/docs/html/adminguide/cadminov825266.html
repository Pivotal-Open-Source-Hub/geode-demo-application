<h1 class="topictitle1">The <span>Derby</span> Network
Server</h1>



<div><p>The <span>Derby</span> Network
Server provides multi-user connectivity to
<span>Derby</span> databases within a
single system or over a network.</p>

<p>The Network Server uses the standard Distributed Relational Database
Architecture (DRDA) protocol to receive and reply to queries from clients.
Databases are accessed through the
<span>Derby</span> Network Server by using
the <span>Derby</span> Network Client
driver.</p>

<p>The Network Server is a solution for multiple JVMs that connect to the
database, unlike the embedded scenario where only one JVM runs as part of
the system. When <span>Derby</span> is
embedded in a single-JVM application, the embedded JDBC driver calls the local <span>Derby</span> database. When <span>Derby</span> is embedded in a server
framework, the server framework's connectivity software provides data to multiple
client JDBC applications over a network or the Internet.</p>

<div class="p">To run the <span>Derby</span> Network
Server, you need to install the following files:<ul>
<li>On the server side, install <samp class="codeph">derby.jar</samp> and
<samp class="codeph">derbynet.jar</samp>.</li>

<li>On the client side, install <samp class="codeph">derbyclient.jar</samp>.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>There are several ways to manage the
<span>Derby</span> Network Server,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Through the command line</li>

<li>By using <samp class="codeph">.bat</samp> and <samp class="codeph">.ksh</samp> scripts</li>

<li>With your own Java program (written using the Network Server API)</li>

<li>By setting Network Server properties</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="cadminapps59125.html#cadminapps59125">Using the Network Server with preexisting Derby applications</a> explains how
to change existing Java applications that currently run against
<span>Derby</span> in embedded mode to run
against the <span>Derby</span> Network
Server.</p>

<p><a href="cadminconfig86869.html#cadminconfig86869">Managing the Derby Network Server</a> explains
how to manage the Network Server by using the command line, including starting
and stopping it.</p>

<p><a href="cadminadvtops.html#cadminadvtops">Derby Network Server advanced topics</a> contains advanced
topics for <span>Derby</span> Network
Server users.</p>

<p>Because of the differences in JDBC drivers that are used, you might encounter
differences in functionality when running
<span>Derby</span> in the Network Server
framework as opposed to running it embedded in a user application. Refer to
<a href="cadminapps59125.html#cadminapps59125">Using the Network Server with preexisting Derby applications</a> for a complete list of
the differences between embedded and Network Server configurations.</p>
