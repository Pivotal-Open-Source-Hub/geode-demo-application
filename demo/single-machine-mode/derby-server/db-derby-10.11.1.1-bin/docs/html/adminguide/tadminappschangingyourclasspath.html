<h1 class="topictitle1">Installing required jar files and adding them to the classpath</h1>



<div><p>To use the Network Server and network client driver, add the
following jar file to your server classpath.</p>

<div class="section">
<ul>
<li><samp class="codeph">derbyrun.jar</samp></li>

</ul>

<p>Adding this file to your classpath has the effect of including all of the
<span>Derby</span> classes in your 
classpath. These classes are in the following jar files, which you can also add
to your classpath separately:</p>

</div>

<ul>
<li class="stepexpand"><span><samp class="codeph">derbynet.jar</samp></span> <p>This jar file contains
the Network Server code. It must be in your classpath to start the Network
Server.</p>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span><samp class="codeph">derby.jar</samp></span>
 <p>This jar file contains the
<span>Derby</span> database engine code.
It must be in the classpath in order for the Network Server to access 
<span>Derby</span> databases. 
<samp class="codeph">derby.jar</samp> is included in the <samp class="codeph">Class-Path</samp>
attribute of <samp class="codeph">derbynet.jar</samp>'s manifest file. If you have
<samp class="codeph">derbynet.jar</samp> in the classpath and <samp class="codeph">derby.jar</samp> is
in the same directory as <samp class="codeph">derbynet.jar</samp>, it is not necessary to
include <samp class="codeph">derby.jar</samp> explicitly.</p>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span><samp class="codeph">derbyclient.jar</samp></span>
 <p>This jar file contains the
<span>Derby</span> Network Client JDBC
driver that is necessary for communication with the Network Server. It must be
in the classpath of the application on the client side in order to access 
<span>Derby</span> databases over a
network.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<div class="example"><p>All of the jar files are in the 
<samp class="codeph">$<span>DERBY_HOME</span>/lib</samp>
directory.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> provides script
files for setting the classpath to work with the Network Server. The scripts are
located in the
<samp class="codeph">$<span>DERBY_HOME</span>/bin</samp>
directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><samp class="codeph">setNetworkClientCP.bat</samp> (Windows)</li>

<li><samp class="codeph">setNetworkClientCP</samp> (UNIX)</li>

<li><samp class="codeph">setNetworkServerCP.bat</samp> (Windows)</li>

<li><samp class="codeph">setNetworkServerCP</samp> (UNIX)</li>

</ul>
