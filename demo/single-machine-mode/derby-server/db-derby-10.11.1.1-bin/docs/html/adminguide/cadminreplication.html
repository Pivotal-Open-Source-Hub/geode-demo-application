<h1 class="topictitle1">Replicating databases</h1>



<div><p>Replication is an important feature of a robust database management
system. In <span>Derby</span>, you start
database replication by using connection URL attributes.</p>
<p>The replication capability of
<span>Derby</span> has the following
features:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>One master, one slave</strong>: A replicated database resides in two locations
and is managed by two different
<span>Derby</span> instances. One of these
<span>Derby</span> instances has the
<em>master</em> role for this database, and the other has the <em>slave</em> role.
Typically, the master and slave run on different nodes, but this is not a
requirement. Together, the master and its associated slave represent a
<em>replication pair</em>.
</li>

<li><strong>Roll-forward shipped log</strong>: Replication is based on shipping the
<span>Derby</span> transaction log from
the master to the slave, and then rolling forward the operations described in
the log to the slave database.
</li>

<li><strong>Asymmetry</strong>: Only the master processes transactions. The slave
processes no transactions, not even read operations.
</li>

<li><strong>Asynchronicity</strong>: Transactions are committed on the master without
waiting for the slave. The shipping of the transaction log to the slave is
performed regularly, and is completely decoupled from the transaction execution
at the master. This may lead to a few lost transactions if the master crashes.
</li>

<li><strong>Shared nothing</strong>: Apart from the network line, no hardware is assumed
to be shared.
</li>

<li><strong>Replication granularity</strong>: The granularity for replication is exactly
one database. However, one
<span>Derby</span> instance may have
different roles for different databases. For example, one
<span>Derby</span> instance may have the
following roles, all at the same time:
<ul>
<li>The master role for one database D1 replicated to one node</li>

<li>The slave role for a database D2 replicated from another node</li>

<li>The normal, non-replicated, role for a database D3</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Replication builds on
<span>Derby</span>'s ability to recover
from a crash by starting with a backup and rolling forward
<span>Derby</span>'s transaction log
files. The master sends log records to the slave using a network connection. The
slave then writes these log records to its local log and redoes them.
</p>

<p>If the master fails, the slave completes the recovery by redoing the log that
has not already been processed. The state of the slave after this recovery is
close to the state the master had when it crashed. However, some of the last
transactions performed on the master may not have been sent to the slave and may
therefore not be reflected. When the slave has completed the recovery work, it
is transformed into a normal
<span>Derby</span> instance that is ready
to process transactions. For more details, see
<a href="cadminreplicfailover.html#cadminreplicfailover">Forcing a failover</a> and
<a href="cadminreplicsecurity.html#cadminreplicsecurity">Replication and security</a>.
</p>

<p>Several <span>Derby</span> properties
allow you to specify the size of the replication log buffers and the intervals
between log shipments, as well as whether replication messages are logged. See
the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for details.</p>

<p>You can perform replication on a database that runs in either embedded mode
or Network Server mode.

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminreplicstartrun.html">Starting and running replication</a></strong><br />
Each replicated database is replicated from a master to a slave version of that database.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminreplicstop.html">Stopping replication</a></strong><br />
To stop replication of a database, connect to the master database using the stopMaster=true connection URL attribute.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminreplicfailover.html">Forcing a failover</a></strong><br />
At any time, you can transform the Derby database that has the slave role into a normal Derby database that can process transactions. This transformation from being a slave to becoming an active Derby database is called failover.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminreplicsecurity.html">Replication and security</a></strong><br />
If you want to perform replication with the security manager enabled, you must modify the security policy file on both the master and slave systems to allow the master-slave network connection.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminreplicfailures.html">Replication failure handling</a></strong><br />
Replication can encounter several failure situations. The following table lists these situations and describes the actions that Derby takes as a result.</li>
