<h1 class="topictitle1">Using Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> includes a
set of MBeans (Managed Beans) and their attributes and operations, providing
monitoring and management capabilities.</p>

<p>Before using the <span>Derby</span>
MBeans, you should have a basic understanding of JMX technology. A good source
of information is the "Monitoring and Management for the Java Platform" web page
at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/
</a>.</p>

<p>The <span>Derby</span> MBeans
instrument one or more parts of a running
<span>Derby</span> system. This
instrumentation gives you real-time access to
<span>Derby</span>-specific information
and features from a host of your choice, if you configure your Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) and the <span>Derby</span>
security features to enable this access.</p>

<p>The <span>Derby</span> JMX features are
automatically available when
<span>Derby</span> is started in a JVM
that supports the platform MBean server. Most versions of the Java SE platform
support JMX technology (Java SE 8 Compact Profile 2, for example, does not).</p>

<p>You start <span>Derby</span> by loading
the <span>Derby</span> embedded driver. If
you are using the <span>Derby</span>
Network Server, the embedded driver is automatically loaded in the server JVM
when the server is started.</p>

<p>You may access the <span>Derby</span>
MBeans by using an existing JMX client utility such as JConsole, or
programmatically by writing your own Java code that uses JMX.</p>
