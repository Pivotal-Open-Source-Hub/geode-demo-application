<h1 class="topictitle1">About this guide and the Network Server documentation</h1>



<div><p>This guide assumes that you are familiar with
<span>Derby</span> features and
tuning.</p>

<p>Before reading this guide, you should first learn about basic
<span>Derby</span> functionality by
reading the <span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span>. Also, because
multi-user environments typically have performance and tuning issues, you should
read <span><em>Tuning Derby</em></span>.</p>
