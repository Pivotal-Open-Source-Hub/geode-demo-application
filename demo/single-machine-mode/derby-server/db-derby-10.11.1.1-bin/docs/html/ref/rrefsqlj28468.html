<h1 class="topictitle1">Capitalization and special characters</h1>



<div><p>Using the classes and methods of JDBC, you submit SQL statements to
<span>Derby</span> as strings. The
character set permitted for strings containing SQL statements is
Unicode.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="p">Within these strings, the following rules apply:   <ul>
<li>Double quotation marks delimit special identifiers referred to in SQL
as <em>delimited identifiers</em>. </li>

<li>Single quotation marks delimit character strings.</li>

<li>Within a character string, to represent a single quotation mark or apostrophe,
use two single quotation marks. (In other words, a single quotation mark is
the escape character for a single quotation mark.)   <p>A double quotation
mark does not need an escape character. To represent a double quotation mark,
simply use a double quotation mark. However, note that in a Java
program, a double quotation mark requires the backslash escape character.</p>
<span><strong>Example:</strong></span><pre><strong><span>-- a single quotation mark is the escape character
-- for a single quotation mark</span>

VALUES 'Joe''s umbrella'
<span>-- in ij, you don't need to escape the double quotation marks</span>
VALUES 'He said, "hello!"'

n = stmt.executeUpdate(
    "UPDATE aTable setStringcol = 'He said, \"hello!\"'");</strong></pre>
</li>

<li>SQL keywords are case-insensitive. For example, you can type the keyword
SELECT as SELECT, Select, select, or sELECT.</li>

<li>SQL-style identifiers are case-insensitive (see
<em><a href="crefsqlj34834.html">SQLIdentifier</a></em>), unless they are delimited.</li>

<li>Java-style identifiers are always case-sensitive.</li>

<li>* is a wildcard within a <em><a href="rrefselectexpression.html#rrefselectexpression">selectExpression</a>.</em> See <a href="rrefselectexpression.html#rrefselectexpression__sqlj38441">The * wildcard</a>. It
can also be the multiplication operator. In all other cases, it is a syntactical
metasymbol that flags items you can repeat 0 or more times.</li>

<li>% and _ are character wildcards when used within character strings following
a LIKE operator (except when escaped with an escape character). See <a href="rrefsqlj23075.html#rrefsqlj23075">Boolean expressions</a>.</li>

<li>Comments can be either single-line or multiline as per the SQL standard. Single-line
comments start with two dashes (--) and end with the newline character. Multiline 
comments are bracketed, start with forward slash star (/*), and end with star 
forward slash (*/). Note that bracketed comments may be nested. Any text between 
the starting and ending comment character sequence is ignored.</li>
