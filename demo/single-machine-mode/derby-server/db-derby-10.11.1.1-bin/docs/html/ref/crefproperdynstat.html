<h1 class="topictitle1">Dynamic and static properties</h1>



<div><p>A property in
<span>Derby</span> can be dynamic or
static.</p>

<p>Most properties are dynamic; that means you can set them while
<span>Derby</span> is running, and their
values change without requiring a reboot of
<span>Derby</span>. In some cases, this
change takes place immediately; in some cases, it takes place at the next
connection.</p>

<p>Some properties are static, which means changes to their values will not
take effect while <span>Derby</span> is
running. You must restart or set them before (or while) starting
<span>Derby</span>.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>Properties set in the <em>derby.properties</em> file and on the command line
of the application that boots
<span>Derby</span> are <em>always</em>
static, because <span>Derby</span> reads
this file and those parameters only at startup.</div>

<p>Only properties set in the following ways have the potential to be
dynamic:</p>

<ul>
<li>As database-wide properties</li>

<li>As system-wide properties via a <em>Properties</em> object in the application
in which the <span>Derby</span> engine is
embedded</li>

</ul>
