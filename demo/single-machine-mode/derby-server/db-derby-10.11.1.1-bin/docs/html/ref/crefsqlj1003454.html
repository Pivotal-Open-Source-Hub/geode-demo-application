<h1 class="topictitle1">Rules for SQL identifiers</h1>



<div><p>Ordinary identifiers are identifiers not surrounded by double
quotation marks. Delimited identifiers are identifiers surrounded by double
quotation marks.</p>

<p>An ordinary identifier must begin with a letter and contain only letters,
underscore characters (_), and digits. The permitted letters and digits include
all Unicode letters and digits, but <span>Derby</span> does
not attempt to ensure that the characters in identifiers are valid in the
database's locale. </p>

<p>A
delimited identifier can contain any characters within the double quotation
marks. The enclosing double quotation marks are not part of the identifier;
they serve only to mark its beginning and end. Spaces at the end of a delimited
identifier are insignificant (truncated). <span>Derby</span> translates
two consecutive double quotation marks within a delimited identifier as one
double quotation mark-that is, the "translated" double quotation mark becomes
a character in the delimited identifier.</p>

<p>Periods within delimited identifiers are not separators but are part of
the identifier (the name of the dictionary object being represented).</p>

<div class="p">So, in the following example:   <pre><strong>"A.B"</strong></pre>
</div>

<div class="p">is a dictionary object, while   <pre><strong>"A"."B"</strong></pre>
</div>

<p>is a dictionary object qualified by another dictionary object (such as
a column named "B" within the table "A").</p>
