<div><p>Most properties are dynamic; that means you can set them while
<span>Derby</span> is running, and their
values change without requiring a reboot of
<span>Derby</span>. In some cases, this
change takes place immediately; in some cases, it takes place at the next
connection.</p>

<p>Some properties are static, which means changes to their values will not
take effect while <span>Derby</span> is
running. You must restart or set them before (or while) starting
<span>Derby</span>.</p>
