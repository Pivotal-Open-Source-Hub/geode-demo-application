<h1 class="topictitle1">Embedded systems and properties</h1>



<div><p>Database-wide properties are stored in the database and are simpler
for deployment, while system-wide parameters might be easier for development.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are setting any system-wide properties, see if they can be set
as database-wide properties instead.</li>

<li>Are any properties being set in the <em>derby.properties</em> file? Some
properties can only be set on a system-wide basis. If so, deploy the entire
system directory along with the properties file. Deploy only those databases
that you wish to include. Setting properties programmatically can simplify
this step- you will not have to worry about deploying the system directory/properties
file.</li>

</ul>

<p>Extra steps are required for deploying an application and an embedded database
on read-only media.</p>
