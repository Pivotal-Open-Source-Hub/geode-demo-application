<h1 class="topictitle1">Differences between LIKE and equal (=) comparisons</h1>



<div><p>When you use locale-based collation, the comparisons
can return different results when you use the LIKE and equal
(=) operators.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>For example, suppose that the
<span>Derby</span> database is set to use
a locale where the character 'z' has the same collation elements as 'xy'. 
Consider the following two WHERE clauses:</p>

<ol>
<li>WHERE 'zcb' = 'xycb'</li>

<li>WHERE 'zcb' LIKE 'xy_b'</li>

</ol>

<p>For WHERE clause 1, <span>Derby</span>
returns TRUE, because the collation elements for the entire string 'zcb' will
match the collation elements of the entire string 'xycb'.</p>

<p>For WHERE clause 2, <span>Derby</span>
returns FALSE, because the collation element for the character 'z' does not
match the collation element for the character 'x'. In addition, when a
metacharacter such as an underscore is used with the LIKE operator, the
metacharacter counts for one character in the string value. A clause such as
<samp class="codeph">WHERE 'xycb' LIKE '_cb'</samp> returns FALSE, because
'x' is compared to the metacharacter '_' and 'y' does not match 'c'.</p>
