<h1 class="topictitle1">Configuring deadlock detection and lock wait timeouts</h1>



<div><p>You configure the amount of time a transaction waits before <span>Derby</span> does any deadlock checking
with the <em>derby.locks.deadlockTimeout</em> property.</p>

<p>You configure the amount of time a transaction waits before timing out
with the <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.waitTimeout</em></samp> property. When configuring
your database or system, you should consider these properties together. For
example, in order for any deadlock checking to occur, the <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.deadlockTimeout</em></samp> property
must be set to a value lower than the <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.waitTimeout</em></samp> property.
If it is set to a value equal to or higher than the <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.waitTimeout</em></samp>,
the transaction times out before <span>Derby</span> does
any deadlock checking.</p>

<p>By default, <em>derby.locks.waitTimeout</em> is
set to 60 seconds. -1 is the equivalent of no wait timeout. This means that
transactions never time out, although <span>Derby</span> can
choose a transaction as a deadlock victim.</p>

<p>In the following figure, <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.deadlockTimeout</em></samp>
is set to 30 seconds, while <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.waitTimeout</em></samp> has
no limit.</p>

deadlock checking after 30 seconds and no lock wait timeouts</span>
<br /><img src="lockwa3.gif" alt="This figure shows a configuration in which transactions are never aborted unless they are selected as the victim when deadlocks are checked. If at 30 seconds there is no deadlock, the transaction will wait until it can obtain a lock (or forever)." /><br />
</div>

<p>In the following figure, <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.deadlockTimeout</em></samp>
is set to 60 seconds, while <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.waitTimeout</em></samp> is
set to 90 seconds.</p>

<p>In the following figure, <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.deadlockTimeout</em></samp>
is set to 60 seconds, while <samp class="codeph"><em>derby.locks.waitTimeout</em></samp> is
set to 50 seconds, lower than the deadlock timeout limit.</p>
