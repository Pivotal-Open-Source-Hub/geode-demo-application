<h1 class="topictitle1">The installation directory</h1>



<div><p>You may install the <span>Derby</span> software
in a directory of your choice.</p>

<p>See the <samp class="codeph">index.html</samp> file for pointers to information on <span>Derby</span>.</p>

<p>The distribution includes setup scripts that use an environment
variable called <span>DERBY_HOME</span>.
The variable's value is set to the <span>Derby</span> base
directory.</p>

<pre>C:&gt;echo %<span>DERBY_HOME</span>%
C:\<span>DERBY_HOME</span></pre>

<p>If you want to set your own environment, <cite><span><em>Getting Started with Derby</em></span></cite> instructs
you on setting its value to the directory in which you installed the <span>Derby</span> software.</p>

<p>The distribution for <span>Derby</span> contains
all the files you need, including the documentation set, some example applications,
and a sample database.</p>

<p>Details about the installation:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>index.html </em>in the top-level directory is the top page for the on-line
documentation.</li>

<li><em>RELEASE-NOTES.html</em>, in the top-level <span>Derby</span> base
directory, contains important last-minute information. <em>Read it first</em>.</li>

<li><em>/bin</em> contains utilities and scripts for running <span>Derby</span>. </li>

<li><em>/demo</em> contains some sample applications, useful scripts, and prebuilt
databases.   <ul>
<li><em>/databases</em> includes prebuilt sample databases.</li>

<li><em>/programs</em> includes sample applications.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><em>/docs</em> contains the on-line documentation (including this document).</li>

<li><em>/javadoc</em> contains the documented APIs for the public classes and
interfaces. Typically, you use the JDBC interface to interact with <span>Derby</span>;
however, you can use some of these additional classes in certain situations.</li>

<li><em>/lib</em> contains the <span>Derby</span> libraries.</li>

</ul>
