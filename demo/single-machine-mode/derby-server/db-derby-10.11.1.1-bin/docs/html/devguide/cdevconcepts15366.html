<h1 class="topictitle1">Isolation levels and concurrency</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> provides
four transaction isolation levels. Setting the transaction isolation level
for a connection allows a user to specify how severely the user's transaction
should be isolated from other transactions.</p>

<p>For example, it allows you to specify whether transaction A is allowed
to make changes to data that have been viewed by transaction B before transaction
B has committed.</p>

<p>A connection determines its own isolation level, so JDBC provides an application
with a way to specify a level of transaction isolation. It specifies four
levels of transaction isolation. The higher the transaction isolation, the
more care is taken to avoid conflicts; avoiding conflicts sometimes means
locking out transactions. Lower isolation levels thus allow greater concurrency.</p>

<p>Inserts, updates, and deletes always behave the same no matter what the
isolation level is. Only the behavior of select statements varies.</p>

<p>To set isolation levels you can use the JDBC <em>Connection.setTransactionIsolation</em> method
or the SQL SET ISOLATION statement.</p>

<p>If there is an active transaction, the network client driver always commits 
the active transaction, whether you use the JDBC 
<em>Connection.setTransactionIsolation</em> method or the SQL SET ISOLATION 
statement. It does this even if the method call or statement does not actually 
change the isolation level (that is, if it sets the isolation level to its 
current value). The embedded driver also always commits the active transaction 
if you use the SET ISOLATION statement. However, if you use the 
<em>Connection.setTransactionIsolation</em> method, the embedded driver commits 
the active transaction only if the call to <em>Connection.setTransactionIsolation</em> 
actually changes the isolation level.</p>

<p>The names of the isolation levels are
different, depending on whether you use a JDBC method or SQL statement. The
following table shows the equivalent names for isolation levels whether they are
set through the JDBC method or an SQL statement.</p>

<p>The transaction isolation level is a way of specifying whether these transaction
anomalies are allowed. The transaction isolation level thus affects the quantity
of data locked by a particular transaction. In addition, a DBMS's locking
schema might also affect whether these anomalies are allowed. A DBMS can lock
either the entire table or only specific rows in order to prevent transaction
anomalies.</p>

<p>The following table shows which anomalies are possible under the various
locking schemas and isolation levels.</p>

<p>The following <em>java.sql.Connection</em> isolation levels are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><samp class="codeph">TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE</samp> <p><samp class="codeph">RR</samp>, <samp class="codeph">SERIALIZABLE</samp>,
or <samp class="codeph">REPEATABLE READ</samp> from SQL.</p>
 <p><em>TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE</em> means
that <span>Derby</span> treats the transactions
as if they occurred serially (one after the other) instead of concurrently. <span>Derby</span> issues locks to prevent
all the transaction anomalies listed in <a href="cdevconcepts15366.html#cdevconcepts15366__cdevconcepts17741">Transaction anomalies</a> from
occurring. The type of lock it issues is sometimes called a <em>range lock</em>.</p>
</li>

<li><samp class="codeph">TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ</samp>   <p><samp class="codeph">RS</samp> from
SQL.</p>
 <p><em>TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ</em> means that <span>Derby</span> issues
locks to prevent only dirty reads and nonrepeatable reads, but not phantoms.
It does not issue range locks for selects.</p>
</li>

<li><samp class="codeph">TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED</samp>  <p><samp class="codeph">CS</samp> or <samp class="codeph">CURSOR
STABILITY</samp> from SQL.</p>
 <p><em>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED</em> means
that <span>Derby</span> issues locks
to prevent only dirty reads, not all the transaction anomalies listed in <a href="cdevconcepts15366.html#cdevconcepts15366__cdevconcepts17741">Transaction anomalies</a>.</p>

<p><em>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED</em> is
the default isolation level for transactions.</p>
</li>

<li><samp class="codeph">TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED</samp>   <p><samp class="codeph">UR</samp>, <samp class="codeph">DIRTY
READ</samp>, or <samp class="codeph">READ UNCOMMITTED</samp> from SQL.</p>
 <p>For a
SELECT INTO, FETCH with a read-only cursor, full select used in an INSERT,
full select/subquery in an UPDATE/DELETE, or scalar full select (wherever
used), READ UNCOMMITTED allows:</p>
 <ul>
<li>Any row that is read during the unit of work to be changed by other application
processes.</li>

<li>Any row that was changed by another application process to be read even
if the change has not been committed by the application process.</li>

</ul>
<p>For other operations, the rules that apply to READ COMMITTED also
apply to READ UNCOMMITTED.</p>
</li>

</ul>
