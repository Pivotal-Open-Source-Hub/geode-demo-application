<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating a case-insensitive database</h1>



<div><p>When you create a database using locale-based collation, the
<em>collation=collation</em> value TERRITORY_BASED uses the default
collation strength for the locale, usually TERTIARY, which will consider
character case significant in searches and comparisons.</p>

<div class="section"><p>To make the database use case-insensitive searches, specify an
explicit strength lower than TERTIARY with the <em>collation=collation</em>
attribute. The strength name is appended to TERRITORY_BASED with a colon to
separate them.</p>

<p>For example, you could specify the following connection URL:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:SwedishDB;create=true;territory=sv_SE;collation=TERRITORY_BASED:PRIMARY</pre>

<p>With strength PRIMARY, the characters 'A' and 'a' will be considered equal,
as well as 'Ã ' ('a' with a grave accent). (This behavior is
commonly the default with many other databases.) To make searches
respect differences in accent, use strength SECONDARY.</p>

<p>The exact interpretation of the strength part of the attribute depends upon
the locale.</p>

<p>For more information, see
<a href="tdevdvlpcollation.html#tdevdvlpcollation">Creating a database with locale-based collation</a> and the
documentation of the <em>territory=ll_CC</em> and <em>collation=collation</em>
attributes in the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>
