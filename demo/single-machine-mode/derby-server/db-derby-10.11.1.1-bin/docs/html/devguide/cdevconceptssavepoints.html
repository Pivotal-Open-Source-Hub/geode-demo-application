<h1 class="topictitle1">Using savepoints</h1>



<div><p>The <em>Savepoint</em> interface contains
methods to set, release, or roll back a transaction to designated savepoints.
Once a savepoint has been set, the transaction can be rolled back to that
savepoint without affecting preceding work. Savepoints provide finer-grained
control of transactions by marking intermediate points within a transaction.
</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Setting and rolling back to a savepoint</h2>
<p>The <em>Connection.setSavepoint</em> method sets a savepoint within the current
transaction. The <em>Connection.rollback</em> method is overloaded to take a
savepoint argument.</p>

<div class="p">The code example below inserts a row into a table, sets the savepoint
<samp class="codeph">svpt1</samp>, and then inserts a second row. When the transaction is
later rolled back to <samp class="codeph">svpt1</samp>, the second insertion is undone, but
the first insertion remains intact. In other words, when the transaction is
committed, only the row containing '1' will be added to TABLE1.
<pre><strong>conn.setAutoCommit(false); // Autocommit must be off to use savepoints.
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
int rows = stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO TABLE1 (COL1) VALUES(1)");
// set savepoint
Savepoint svpt1 = conn.setSavepoint("S1");
rows = stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO TABLE1 (COL1) VALUES (2)");
...
conn.rollback(svpt1);
...
conn.commit();</strong></pre>
</div>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Releasing a savepoint </h2>
<p>The method <em>Connection.releaseSavepoint</em> takes a <em>Savepoint</em> object
as a parameter and removes it from the current transaction. Once a savepoint
has been released, attempting to reference it in a rollback operation will
cause an <em>SQLException</em> to be thrown.</p>

<p>Any savepoints that have been created in a transaction are automatically
released and become invalid when the transaction is committed or when the
entire transaction is rolled back.</p>

<p>Rolling a transaction back to a savepoint automatically releases and makes
invalid any other savepoints created after the savepoint in question.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Rules for savepoints</h2>
<p>The savepoint cannot be set within a batch of statements to enable partial
recovery. If a savepoint is set any time before the method <em>executeBatch</em>
is called, it is set before any of the statements that have been added to the
batch are executed.</p>

<p>A savepoint can be reused after it has been released explicitly (by issuing a
release of the savepoint) or implicitly (by issuing a connection
commit/rollback to that savepoint or to a savepoint declared earlier than that
savepoint).</p>

<p>It is possible to nest savepoints, but only in an embedded environment.</p>
