<h1 class="topictitle1">Scope of locks</h1>



<div><p>The amount of data locked by a statement can vary.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Table locks</h2><p>A statement can lock the <em>entire table</em>.</p>
<p>Table-level
locking systems always lock entire tables.</p>
<p>Row-level locking systems
can lock entire tables if the WHERE clause of a statement cannot use an index.
For example, UPDATES that cannot use an index lock the entire table.</p>
<p>Row-level
locking systems can lock entire tables if a high number of single-row locks
would be less efficient than a single table-level lock. Choosing table-level
locking instead of row-level locking for performance reasons is called <em>lock
escalation</em>. For more information about this topic, see "About the system's
selection of lock granularity" and "Transaction-based lock escalation" in
<span><em>Tuning Derby</em></span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Single-row locks</h2><p>A statement can lock only <em>a
single row</em> at a time.</p>
<div class="p">For row-level locking systems:<ul>
<li>For TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ isolation, the locks are released at the
end of the transaction.</li>

<li>For TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED isolation, <span>Derby</span> locks
rows only as the application steps through the rows in the result. The current
row is locked. The row lock is released when the application goes to the next
row.</li>

<li>For TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE isolation, however, <span>Derby</span> locks
the whole set before the application begins stepping through.</li>

<li>For TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED, no row locks are requested.</li>

</ul>
 </div>
<p><span>Derby</span> locks
single rows for INSERT statements, holding each row until the transaction
is committed. If there is an index associated with the table, the previous
key is also locked.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Range locks</h2><p>A statement can lock <em>a range of rows</em> (range
lock).</p>
<div class="p">For row-level locking systems: <ul>
<li>For <em>any</em> isolation level, <span>Derby</span> locks <em>all
the rows in the result</em> plus an entire range of rows for updates or deletes.</li>

<li>For the TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE isolation level, <span>Derby</span> locks
all the rows in the result plus an entire range of rows in the table for SELECTs
to prevent nonrepeatable reads and phantoms.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>For example, if a SELECT statement specifies rows in the <em>Employee</em> table
where the <em>salary</em> is BETWEEN two values, the system can lock more than
just the actual rows it returns in the result. It also must lock the entire <em>range</em> of
rows between those two values to prevent another transaction from inserting,
deleting, or updating a row within that range.</p>
<p>An index must be available
for a range lock. If one is not available, <span>Derby</span> locks
the entire table.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the types and scopes of locking.</p>
