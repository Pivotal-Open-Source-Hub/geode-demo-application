<h1 class="topictitle1">Explicitly closing Statements, ResultSets, and Connections</h1>



<div><p>You should explicitly close <samp class="codeph"><em>Statements</em></samp>,
<samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSets</em></samp>, and <samp class="codeph"><em>Connections</em></samp> when
you no longer need them, unless you declare them in a
<samp class="codeph"><em>try</em></samp>-with-resources statement (available in JDK 7 and
after).</p>

<p>Connections to <span>Derby</span> are
resources external to an application, and the garbage collector will not close
them automatically. </p>

<p>To close a <samp class="codeph"><em>Statement</em></samp>,
<samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp>, or <samp class="codeph"><em>Connection</em></samp> object
that is not declared in a <samp class="codeph"><em>try</em></samp>-with-resources statement,
use its <samp class="codeph"><em>close</em></samp> method. If auto-commit is disabled, you
must explicitly commit or roll back active transactions before you close the
connection.</p>

<p>Statements, result sets, and connections extend
<samp class="codeph"><em>AutoCloseable</em></samp> in JDK 7 and after. If you declare a
connection in a <samp class="codeph"><em>try</em></samp>-with-resources statement and there
is an error that the code does not catch, the JRE will attempt to close the
connection automatically.</p>

<p>Note that a transaction-severity or higher exception causes
<span>Derby</span> to abort an in-flight
transaction. But a statement-severity exception does NOT roll back the
transaction. Also note that
<span>Derby</span> throws an exception if
an attempt is made to close a connection with an in-flight transaction. Suppose
now that a <samp class="codeph"><em>Connection</em></samp> is declared in a 
<samp class="codeph"><em>try</em></samp>-with-resources statement, a transaction is
in-flight, and an unhandled statement-severity error occurs inside the
<samp class="codeph"><em>try</em></samp>-with-resources block. In this situation,
<span>Derby</span> will raise a follow-on
exception as the JRE exits the <em>try</em>-with-resources block. (For details on
error severity levels, see the documentation of the
<samp class="codeph"><em>derby.stream.error.logSeverityLevel</em></samp> property in the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.)</p>

<p>It is therefore always best to catch errors inside the
<samp class="codeph"><em>try</em></samp>-with-resources block and to either roll back or
commit, as appropriate, to ensure that there is no pending transaction when
leaving the <samp class="codeph"><em>try</em></samp>-with-resources block. This action also
improves application portability, since DBMSs differ in their semantics when
trying to close a connection with a pending transaction.</p>
