<h1 class="topictitle1">Changing the system-wide properties by using the derby.properties file</h1>



<div><p>You can set persistent system-wide properties in a text file called
<em>derby.properties</em>, which must be placed in the directory specified by the
<em>derby.system.home</em> property.</p>

<p>There is one <em>derby.properties</em> file per system, not one per database.
The file must be created in the system directory. In a client/server
environment, that directory is on the server. (For more information about a
<span>Derby</span> system and the system
directory, see <a href="cdevdvlp27610.html#cdevdvlp27610">Derby system</a>.)</p>

<div class="p"><span>Derby</span> does <em>not</em>:
<ul>
<li>Provide this file</li>

<li>Automatically create this file for you</li>

<li>Automatically write any properties or values to this file</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>Instead, you must create, write, and edit this file yourself.</p>

<p>The file should be in the format created by the
<em>java.util.Properties.save</em> method.</p>

<div class="p">The following is the text of a sample properties file:
<pre><strong>derby.infolog.append=true 
derby.storage.pageSize=8192
derby.storage.pageReservedSpace=60</strong></pre>
</div>

<p>Properties set this way are persistent for the system until changed, until
the file is removed from the system, or until the system is booted in some
other directory (in which case
<span>Derby</span> would be looking for
<em>derby.properties</em> in that new directory). If a database is removed from a
system, system-wide properties do not "travel" with the database unless
explicitly set again.</p>
