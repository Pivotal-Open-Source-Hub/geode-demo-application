<h1 class="topictitle1">Booting databases</h1>



<div><p>The default configuration for <span>Derby</span> is
to <em>boot</em> (or start) a database when an application first makes a connection
to it. When <span>Derby</span> boots
a database, it checks to see if recovery needs to be run on the database,
so in some unusual cases booting can take some time.</p>

<p>You can also configure your system to automatically boot all databases
in the system when it starts up; see "<em>derby.system.bootAll</em>" in the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>. Because of the time needed
to boot a database, the number of databases in the system directory affects
startup performance if you use that configuration. </p>

<p>Once a database has been booted within a <span>Derby</span> system,
it remains active until the <span>Derby</span> system
has been shut down or until you shut down the database individually.</p>

<p>When <span>Derby</span> boots a database,
a message is added to the log file. The message includes the
<span>Derby</span> version that the
database was booted with, along with information about the Java version,
the user's working directory, and the location of the
<span>Derby</span> system directory, if
the user specified it using the <em>derby.system.home</em> property. If
<em>derby.system.home</em> was not specified, its value is reported as null, as in
the following example:</p>
