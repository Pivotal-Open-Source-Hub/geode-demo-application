<h1 class="topictitle1">Locking, concurrency, and isolation</h1>



<div><p>This section discusses topics pertinent to multi-user systems,
in which concurrency is important.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> is configured
by default to work well for multi-user systems. For single-user systems, you
might want to tune your system so that it uses fewer resources; see <a href="cdevconcepts23810.html#cdevconcepts23810">Lock granularity</a>.</p>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts15366.html">Isolation levels and concurrency</a></strong><br />
Derby provides four transaction isolation levels. Setting the transaction isolation level for a connection allows a user to specify how severely the user's transaction should be isolated from other transactions.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts22300.html">Configuring isolation levels</a></strong><br />
If a connection does not specify its isolation level, it inherits the default isolation level for the Derby system. The default value is CS.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts23810.html">Lock granularity</a></strong><br />
Derby can be configured for table-level locking. With table-level locking, when a transaction locks data in order to prevent any transaction anomalies, it always locks the entire table, not just those rows being accessed.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts36402.html">Types and scope of locks in Derby systems</a></strong><br />
There are several types of locks available in Derby systems, including exclusive, shared, and update locks.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts28436.html">Deadlocks</a></strong><br />
In a database, a deadlock is a situation in which two or more transactions are waiting for one another to give up locks.</li>
</ul>
