<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcollationoverview.html">How collation works in Derby</a></strong><br />
Derby supports a wide range of character sets and encodes all of the character sets by using the Unicode support provided by the java.lang.Character class in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in which the Derby database runs.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcollationlocale.html">Locale-based collation</a></strong><br />
Derby supports the ability to define collation rules that are appropriate to a locale. This is referred to as locale-based collation.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcollationattribs.html">Database connection URL attributes that control collation</a></strong><br />
When you create a Derby database, the attributes that you set determine the collation that is used with all character data in the database.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcollationexamples.html">Examples of case-sensitive and case-insensitive string sorting</a></strong><br />
These examples show the results of sorts on databases created with various collation and locale attributes.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcollationlikeequal.html">Differences between LIKE and equal (=) comparisons</a></strong><br />
When you use locale-based collation, the comparisons can return different results when you use the LIKE and equal (=) operators.</li>
</ul>
