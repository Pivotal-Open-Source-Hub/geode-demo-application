<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating, dropping, and backing up databases</h1>



<div><p>You create new databases and access existing ones by specifying
attributes to the <span>Derby</span> connection
URL.</p>

<p>If you use an in-memory database, you can use a connection URL attribute
to drop it. For a file system database, however, there is no drop attribute. To
drop a database on the file system, delete the database
directory with operating system commands. The database must not be booted
when you remove a database. You can get a list of booted databases with <em>getPropertyInfo</em>.</p>

<p>To back up a database, you can use the online backup utility. For information
on this utility, see the <cite><span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span></cite>.</p>

<p>You can also use <em>roll-forward recovery</em> to recover a damaged database. <span>Derby</span> accomplishes roll-forward
recovery by using a full backup copy of the database, archived logs, and active
logs from the most recent time before a failure. For more information on roll-forward
recovery see the <cite><span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span></cite>.</p>
