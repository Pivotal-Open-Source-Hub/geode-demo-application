<div><p>In a client/server environment, you must set the system properties
for the <em>server</em>'s system. That means that when you are using the
<em>derby.properties</em> file, the file exists in the <em>server</em>'s
<em>derby.system.home</em> directory. Client applications can set database-wide
properties because they are set via SQL statements.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the ways to set properties.</p>
