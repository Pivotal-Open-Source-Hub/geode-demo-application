<h1 class="topictitle1">Upgrades</h1>



<div><p>To connect to a database created with a previous version of <span>Derby</span>, you must first upgrade
that database.</p>

<p>Upgrading involves writing changes to the system tables, so it is not possible
for databases on read-only media. The upgrade process:</p>

<ul>
<li>marks the database as upgraded to the current release (Version <span>10.11</span>).</li>

<li>allows use of new features.</li>

</ul>

<p>See the release notes for more information on upgrading your databases
to this version of <span>Derby</span>.</p>
