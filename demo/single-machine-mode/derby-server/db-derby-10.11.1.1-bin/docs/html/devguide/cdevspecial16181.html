<h1 class="topictitle1">Database-side JDBC routines using non-nested connections</h1>



<div><p>A database-side JDBC routine can create a new connection instead
of using a nested connection. Statements executed in the routine will be
part of a different transaction, and so can issue commits and rollbacks.</p>

<p>Such a routine can connect to a database different from the one to which
the parent SQL statement that called it is connected. The routine does not
use the same transaction or <em>Connection</em>. It establishes a new <em>Connection</em> and
transaction.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>If database-side JDBC routines do not use nested connections, this
means that they are operating outside of the normal DBMS transaction control,
so it is not good practice to use them indiscriminately.</div>
