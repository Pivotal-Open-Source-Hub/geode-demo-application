<h1 class="topictitle1">Deadlocks</h1>



<div><p>In a database, a deadlock is a situation in which two or more transactions
are waiting for one another to give up locks.</p>

<p>For example, Transaction A might hold a lock on some rows in the <em>Accounts</em> table
and needs to update some rows in the <em>Orders</em> table to finish. Transaction
B holds locks on those very rows in the <em>Orders</em> table but needs to update
the rows in the <em>Accounts</em> table held by Transaction A. Transaction A
cannot complete its transaction because of the lock on <em>Orders</em>. Transaction
B cannot complete its transaction because of the lock on <em>Accounts</em>.
All activity comes to a halt and remains at a standstill forever unless the
DBMS detects the deadlock and aborts one of the transactions. The following
figure shows this situation.</p>

<div class="fignone"><span class="figcap">Figure 1. A deadlock where two transactions are waiting
for one another to give up locks</span>
<br /><img src="dead.gif" alt="This figure depicts a deadlock. Transaction A has a lock on the Accounts table and needs a lock on the Orders table to finish the transaction. Transaction B has a lock on the Orders table and needs a lock on the Accounts table to finish the transaction." /><br />

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts53677.html">Avoiding deadlocks</a></strong><br />
Using both row-level locking and the TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED isolation level makes it likely that you will avoid deadlocks (both settings are Derby defaults). However, deadlocks are still possible.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts95005.html">Deadlock detection</a></strong><br />
When a transaction waits more than a specific amount of time to obtain a lock (called the deadlock timeout), Derby can detect whether the transaction is involved in a deadlock.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts89097.html">Lock wait timeouts</a></strong><br />
Even if a transaction is not involved in a deadlock, it might have to wait a considerable amount of time to obtain a lock because of a long-running transaction or transactions holding locks on the tables it needs.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts16400.html">Configuring deadlock detection and lock wait timeouts</a></strong><br />
You configure the amount of time a transaction waits before Derby does any deadlock checking with the derby.locks.deadlockTimeout property.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts50894.html">Debugging deadlocks</a></strong><br />
If deadlocks occur frequently in your multi-user system with a particular application, you might need to do some debugging.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevconcepts32861.html">Programming applications to handle deadlocks</a></strong><br />
When you configure your system for deadlock and lockwait timeouts and an application could be chosen as a victim when the transaction times out, you should program your application to handle them.</li>
