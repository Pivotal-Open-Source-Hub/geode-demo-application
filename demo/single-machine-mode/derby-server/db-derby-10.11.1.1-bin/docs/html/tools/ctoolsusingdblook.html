<h1 class="topictitle1">Using dblook</h1>



<div><p>The syntax for the command to launch the <samp class="codeph">dblook</samp>
utility is as follows.</p>

<pre><strong>dblook -d <em>connectionURL</em> [<em>options</em>]</strong></pre>

<p>The value for <var class="varname">connectionURL</var> is the complete URL for the
database. Where appropriate, the URL includes any connection URL attributes that
might be required to access the database. For complete information on connection
URL attributes, see "Setting attributes for the database connection URL" in the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>

<p>For example, to connect to the database <samp class="codeph">myDB</samp>, the URL would
simply be <samp class="codeph">'jdbc:derby:myDB'</samp>. To connect using the Network
Server to the database <samp class="codeph">'C:\private\tmp\myDB'</samp> on a remote server
(port 1527), the URL would be:</p>

<pre>'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/"C:\private\tmp\myDB";user=someusr;password=somepwd'</pre>

<p>As with other <span>Derby</span>
utilities, you must ensure that no other JVMs are started against the database
when you call the <samp class="codeph">dblook</samp> utility, or an exception will occur
and will print to the <samp class="codeph">dblook.log</samp> file. If this exception is
thrown, the <samp class="codeph">dblook</samp> utility will exit. To recover, you must
ensure that no other <span>Derby</span>
applications running in a separate JVM are connected to the source database.
These connections need to be shut down. Once all existing JVMs running against
the database have been shut down, the <samp class="codeph">dblook</samp> utility will
execute successfully.</p>

<p>You can also start the
<span>Derby</span> Network Server and run
the <samp class="codeph">dblook</samp> utility as a client application while other clients
are connected to the server.</p>
