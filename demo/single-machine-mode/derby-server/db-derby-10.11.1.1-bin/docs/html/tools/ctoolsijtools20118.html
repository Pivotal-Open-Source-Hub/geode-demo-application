<h1 class="topictitle1">JDBC connection basics</h1>



<div><p>Most of the <span>Derby</span>
tools are JDBC applications. A JDBC application is one that uses the classes in
the <em>java.sql</em> package to interact with a DBMS.</p>

<p>When you work with JDBC applications, you need to know about several concepts.
The most basic is the <em>connection</em>. A <em>JDBC connection</em> is the object
through which commands are sent to the <span>Derby</span> engine
and responses are returned to the program. Establishing a connection to
a specific database is done by specifying a appropriate database <em>URL</em>.
The following sections provide background information to help in understanding
the <span>Derby</span> database connection
URL.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rtoolsijtools16879.html">JDBC drivers overview</a></strong><br />
Before a JDBC application connects to a database, it must cause the proper JDBC driver to be loaded in the Java session.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctoolsijtools16011.html">Database connection URLs</a></strong><br />
A JDBC URL provides a way of identifying a database so that the appropriate driver recognizes it and connects to it. In the Derby documentation, a JDBC URL is referred to as a database connection URL.</li>
