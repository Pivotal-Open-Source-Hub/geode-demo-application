<div><p>Row-level locking improves concurrency in a multi-user system.
However, a large number of row locks can degrade performance.</p>

<p><a href="ctunoptimz19357.html">About the system's selection of lock granularity</a> discussed the way the optimizer makes
some compile-time decisions about escalating row locks to table locks for
performance reasons. This section discusses ways in which the
<span>Derby</span> system and the user can
make similar lock escalations.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctunoptimz42065.html">Transaction-based lock escalation</a></strong><br />
The optimizer makes its decisions for the scope of a single statement at compile time; the runtime overrides are also for the scope of a single statement.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctunoptimz11775.html">Locking a table for the duration of a transaction</a></strong><br />
You can explicitly lock a table for the duration of a transaction with the LOCK TABLE statement.</li>
