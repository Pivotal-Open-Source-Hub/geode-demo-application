<h1 class="topictitle1">Statement execution plan</h1>



<div><p>RUNTIMESTATISTICS also provides information about the <em>statement
execution plan</em>.</p>

<p>The statement execution plan shows how long each node took to evaluate, how
many rows were retrieved, whether an index was used, and so on. If an index was
used, it shows the start and stop positions for the matching index scan. Looking
at the plan can help you determine whether to add an index or to rewrite the
query.</p>

<p>A statement execution plan is composed of a tree of result set nodes. A
result set node represents the evaluation of one portion of the statement; it
returns rows to a calling (or parent) node and can receive rows from a child
node. A node can have one or more children. Starting from the top, if a node has
children, it requests rows from the children. Usually only the execution plans
of DML statements (queries, inserts, updates, and deletes, not dictionary
object creation) are composed of more than one node.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following query:</p>

<pre><strong>SELECT * FROM Countries</strong></pre>

<p>This simple query involves one node only: reading all the data out of the
<samp class="codeph">Countries</samp> table. It involves a single node with no children.
This result set node is called a <em>Table Scan ResultSet</em>. RUNTIMESTATISTICS
text for this node looks something like this:</p>

<pre>Statement Name:
        null
Statement Text:
        select * from countries
Parse Time: 20
Bind Time: 10
Optimize Time: 50
Generate Time: 20
Compile Time: 100
Execute Time: 10
Begin Compilation Timestamp : 2005-05-25 09:16:21.24
End Compilation Timestamp : 2005-05-25 09:16:21.34
Begin Execution Timestamp : 2005-05-25 09:16:21.35
End Execution Timestamp : 2005-05-25 09:16:21.4
Statement Execution Plan Text:
Table Scan ResultSet for COUNTRIES at read committed isolation
level using instntaneous share row 
locking chosen by the optimizer
Number of opens = 1
Rows seen = 114
Rows filtered = 0
Fetch Size = 16
        constructor time (milliseconds) = 0
        open time (milliseconds) = 0
        next time (milliseconds) = 10
        close time (milliseconds) = 0
        next time in milliseconds/row = 0

scan information:
        Bit set of columns fetched=All
        Number of columns fetched=3
        Number of pages visited=3
        Number of rows qualified=114
        Number of rows visited=114
        Scan type=heap
        start position:
null    stop position:
null    qualifiers:
None
        optimizer estimated row count:          119.00
        optimizer estimated cost:           69.35
</pre>

<p>Consider this second, more complex query:</p>

<pre><strong><span />SELECT Country
FROM Countries
WHERE Region = 'Central America'</strong></pre>

<p>When executed, this query involves two nodes: one to retrieve qualifying rows
(the restriction is done at this node) and one to project the requested columns.
So, at bottom, there is a <em>Table Scan ResultSet</em> for scanning the table.
The qualifier (<samp class="codeph">Region = 'Central America'</samp>) is evaluated in this
node. These data are passed up to the parent node, called a
<em>Project-Restrict ResultSet</em>, in which the rows are projected; only the
<samp class="codeph">country</samp> column is needed (the first column in the table).
RUNTIMESTATISTICS text for these two nodes looks something like this:</p>

<pre>Statement Name:
        null
Statement Text:
        SELECT Country FROM Countries WHERE Region = 'Central America'
Parse Time: 10
Bind Time: 0
Optimize Time: 370
Generate Time: 10
Compile Time: 390

End Compilation Timestamp : 2005-05-25 09:20:41.664

End Execution Timestamp : 2005-05-25 09:20:41.674

                optimizer estimated cost:           69.35
</pre>

<p>Other, more complex queries such as joins and unions have other types of
result set nodes.</p>

<p>For inserts, updates, and deletes, rows flow out of the top, where they are
inserted, updated, or deleted. For selects (queries), rows flow out of the top
into a result set that is returned to the user.</p>

<p>The <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> shows the many possible
<em>ResultSet</em> nodes that might appear in an execution plan.</p>

<span>Derby</span> executes
statements.</p>
