<h1 class="topictitle1">About the optimizer's choice of join strategy</h1>



<div><p>The optimizer compares the cost of choosing a hash join (if a hash
join is possible) to the cost of choosing a nested loop join and chooses the
cheaper strategy.</p>

<p>For information about when hash joins are possible, see
<a href="ctunoptimz23173.html">Join strategies</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, the size of the hash table that
<span>Derby</span> would have to build is
prohibitive and can cause the JVM to run out of memory. For this reason, the
optimizer has an upper limit on the size of a table on which it will consider a
hash join. It will not consider a hash join for a statement if it estimates that
the size of the hash table would exceed the system-wide limit of memory use for
a table; the optimizer chooses a nested loop join instead. The optimizer's
estimates of size of hash tables are approximate only.</p>
