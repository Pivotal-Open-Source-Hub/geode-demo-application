<div><p>The optimizer makes some non-cost-based optimizations, which means
that it does not consider them when determining the access path and join
order.</p>

<p>If all the conditions are right, it makes the optimizations after the access
path and join order are determined.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctunoptimz22460.html">Non-cost-based sort avoidance (tuple filtering)</a></strong><br />
In most cases, Derby needs to perform two separate steps for statements that use DISTINCT or GROUP BY: first sorting the selected columns, then either discarding duplicate rows or aggregating grouped rows. Sometimes it is able to avoid sorting for these statements with tuple filtering.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctunoptimz22111.html">The MIN() and MAX() optimizations</a></strong><br />
The optimizer knows that it can avoid iterating through all the source rows in a result to compute a MIN() or MAX() aggregate when data are already in the right order.</li>
