<h1 class="topictitle1">Join order case study</h1>



<div><p>As an example of how the optimizer chooses a join order, consider the
following situation.</p>

<p>The <samp class="codeph">Flights</samp> table (as you know) stores information about
flight segments. It has a primary key on the <samp class="codeph">flight_id</samp> and
<samp class="codeph">segment_number</samp> columns. This primary key constraint is backed
up by a unique index on those columns.</p>

<p>The <samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp> table, which stores information about
the availability of flight segments on particular days, can store several rows
for a particular row in the <samp class="codeph">Flights</samp> table (one for each
date).</p>

<p>You want to see information about all the flights, and you issue the
following query:</p>

<pre><strong>SELECT *
FROM FlightAvailability AS fa, Flights AS fts
WHERE fa.flight_id = fts.flight_id
AND fa.segment_number = fts.segment_number</strong></pre>

<p>First imagine the situation in which there are no useful indexes on the
<samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp> table.</p>

<p>Using the join order with <samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp> as the outer
table and <samp class="codeph">Flights</samp> as the inner table is cheaper because it
allows the <samp class="codeph">flight_id</samp>/<samp class="codeph">segment_number</samp> columns
from <samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp> to be used to probe into and find
matching rows in <samp class="codeph">Flights</samp>, using the primary key index on
<samp class="codeph">Flights.flight_id</samp> and
<samp class="codeph">Flights.segment_number</samp>.</p>

<p>This is preferable to the opposite join order (with <samp class="codeph">Flights</samp>
as the outer table and <samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp> as the inner table)
because in that case, for each row in <samp class="codeph">Flights</samp>, the system would
have to scan the entire <samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp> table to find the
matching rows (because there is no useful index -- an index on the
<samp class="codeph">flight_id</samp>/<samp class="codeph">segment_number</samp> columns).</p>

<p>Second, imagine the situation in which there is a useful index on the
<samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp> table (this is actually the case in the
sample database). <samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp> has a primary key index on
<samp class="codeph">flight_id</samp>, <samp class="codeph">segment_number</samp>, and
<samp class="codeph">booking_date</samp>. In that index, the
<samp class="codeph">flight_id</samp>/<samp class="codeph">segment_number</samp> combination is not
unique, since there is a one-to-many correspondence between the
<samp class="codeph">Flights</samp> table and the <samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp>
table. However, the index is still very useful for finding rows with particular
<samp class="codeph">flight_id</samp>/<samp class="codeph">segment_number</samp> values.</p>

<p>You issue the same query:</p>

<pre><strong>SELECT *
FROM FlightAvailability AS fa, Flights AS fts
WHERE fa.flight_id = fts.flight_id
AND fa.segment_number = fts.segment_number</strong></pre>

<p>Although the difference in cost is smaller, it is still cheaper for the
<samp class="codeph">Flights</samp> table to be the inner table, because its index is
unique, whereas <samp class="codeph">FlightAvailability</samp>'s index is not. That is
because it is cheaper for
<span>Derby</span> to step through a
unique index than through a non-unique index.</p>
