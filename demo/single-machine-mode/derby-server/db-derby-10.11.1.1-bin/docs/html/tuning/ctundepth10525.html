<div><p><span>Derby</span> is fast and
efficient, but when tables are huge, scanning tables might take longer than a
user would expect. It's even worse if you then ask
<span>Derby</span> to sort this
data.</p>

<p>Things that you can do to avoid table scans fall into two categories.</p>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctundepth23033.html">Always create indexes</a></strong><br />
Useful indexes prevent Derby from having to read an entire table to retrieve the data you need.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctundepth36205.html">Prevent the user from issuing expensive queries</a></strong><br />
Some applications have complete control over the queries that they issue; the queries are built into the applications. Other applications allow users to construct queries by filling in fields on a form.</li>
</ul>
