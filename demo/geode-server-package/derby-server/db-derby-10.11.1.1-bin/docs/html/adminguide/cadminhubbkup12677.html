<h1 class="topictitle1">Offline backups</h1>



<div><p>To perform an offline backup of a database, use operating system
commands to copy the database directory.</p>

<div class="p"><div class="important"><span class="importanttitle">Important: </span>You must shut down the database before you perform an
offline backup.</div>
</div>

<p>For example, on Windows systems, the following operating system command 
backs up a (closed) database that is named <samp class="codeph">sample</samp> and that is
located in <samp class="codeph">d:\mydatabases</samp> by copying it to the directory
<samp class="codeph">c:\mybackups\2012-04-01</samp>:</p>

<pre><strong>xcopy d:\mydatabases\sample c:\mybackups\2012-04-01\sample /s /i</strong></pre>

<p>If you are not using Windows, substitute the appropriate operating
system command for copying a directory and all contents to a new location.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>On Windows systems, do not attempt to update a database while it is being
backed up in this way. Attempting to update a database during an offline
backup will generate a <samp class="codeph">java.io.IOException</samp>. Using online
backups prevents this from occurring.</div>

<p>For large systems, shutting down the database might not be convenient.
To back up a database without having to shut it down, you can use an online
backup.</p>

<p>After you back up a database, make sure the backup copy is not corrupt. To
do this, run the <samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_CHECK_TABLE</samp> system function
on all the tables in the backup copy. Do not discard the previous backup until
you have verified the consistency of the current one. See
<a href="cadminconsist01.html#cadminconsist01">Checking database consistency</a> for more
information.</p>
