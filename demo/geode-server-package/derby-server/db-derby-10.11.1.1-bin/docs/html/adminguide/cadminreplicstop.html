<h1 class="topictitle1">Stopping replication</h1>



<div><p>To stop replication of a database, connect to the master database
using the <samp class="codeph">stopMaster=true</samp> connection URL attribute.</p>

<p>The master sends the remaining log records that await shipment, and then
sends a stop replication command to the slave. The slave then writes all logs to
disk and shuts down the database. For example, for a database named
<samp class="codeph">wombat</samp>, you might specify the following connection URL:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:wombat;stopMaster=true</pre>

<p>To stop replication on the slave system if the connection to the master is
lost, use the <samp class="codeph">stopSlave=true</samp> connection URL attribute.</p>

<p>See the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for details about these
attributes.</p>

<p>You cannot resume replication after it has been stopped. You need to start
replication over again from the beginning using the
<samp class="codeph">startMaster=true</samp> attribute, as described in
<a href="cadminreplicstartrun.html#cadminreplicstartrun">Starting and running replication</a>.</p>
