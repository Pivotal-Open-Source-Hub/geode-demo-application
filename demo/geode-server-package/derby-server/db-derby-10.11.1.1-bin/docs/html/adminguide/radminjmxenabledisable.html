<h1 class="topictitle1">Enabling and disabling JMX</h1>



<div><p>You can use JMX management and monitoring both locally and
remotely.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>The term <dfn class="term">local</dfn> means <em>on the same host (machine)</em> and
<em>running as the same user</em>. For example, this means that local JMX access
is possible only if the JVM you want to access is running on the same host and
as the same user as the user who is running a JMX client such as JConsole (or a
different user with sufficient file system permissions). In order to allow other
users to access the JVM, or to allow access from other hosts, remote JMX must be
enabled.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Local JMX access</h2>
<p>Local JMX management and monitoring are enabled by default on platforms that
support JMX. (Java SE 8 Compact Profile 2, for example, does not support
JMX.)</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Remote JMX access</h2>
<p>Remote JMX management and monitoring is a powerful Java feature, allowing you
to monitor a specific JVM from a remote location. Enabling remote JMX requires
explicit actions by the JVM administrator, since it may involve exposing
sensitive information about your system.</p>

<p>The most common way to enable remote JMX access to your JVM is to specify a
TCP/IP port number and some basic security settings when you start the JVM. The
security settings commonly include authentication and SSL (Secure Socket
Layer). <span>Derby</span> attempts to use
the JVM's built-in platform MBean server. For a list of current command line
options (system properties) and their meanings, refer to the table in the
<cite>Java SE Monitoring and Management Guide</cite> at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html#gdeum" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html#gdeum
</a>.</p>

<p>The following topics describe ways to enable and disable remote JMX
access.</p>

When you start the Network Server from the command line, it installs a security manager and a basic security policy by default.</li>

You may wish to disable or restrict access to MBeans in security-conscious environments. You can do this using either of the following techniques.</li>
