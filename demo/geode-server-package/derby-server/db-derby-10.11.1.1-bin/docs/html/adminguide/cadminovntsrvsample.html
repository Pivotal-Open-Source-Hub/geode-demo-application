<h1 class="topictitle1">Network Server sample programs for embedded and client connections</h1>



<div><p>This <span>Derby</span> Network
Server sample program demonstrates how to obtain an embedded connection and
client connections to the same database by using the Network Server. This
program shows how to use either the <samp class="codeph">DriverManager</samp> or a
DataSource to obtain client connections.</p>

<p>For a database to be consistent, only one JVM can access it at a time.
The embedded driver is loaded when the Network Server is started. The JVM
that starts the Network Server can obtain an embedded connection to the same
database that the Network Server is accessing to serve clients from other
JVMs. This solution provides the performance benefits of the embedded driver
and also allows client connections from other JVMs to connect to the same
database.</p>
