<h1 class="topictitle1">Row-level locking</h1>



<div><p>To support multi-user access,
<span>Derby</span> uses row-level locking.
</p>

<p>However, you can configure
<span>Derby</span> to use table-level
locking in environments that have few concurrent transactions (for example, a
read-only database). Table-level locking is preferable if there are few or no
writes to the server, while row-level locking is essential for good performance
if many clients write to the server concurrently. The <span>Derby</span> optimizer tunes lock
choice for queries automatically.</p>
