<h1 class="topictitle1">Starting and running replication</h1>



<div><p>Each replicated database is replicated from a master to a slave
version of that database.</p>

<p>Initially there is no replication; a master database must be created before
it can be replicated. The database may, of course, be empty when replication
starts. On the other hand, replication does not need to be specified immediately
after the database is created; it can be initiated at any time after the
database is created.</p>

<p>Before you start replication, you must shut down the master database and then
copy the database to the slave location. Follow these
steps to start replication:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure that the database on the master system is shut down cleanly.</li>

<li>Copy the database to the slave location.</li>

<li>Start slave replication mode on the
<span>Derby</span> instance that is acting
as the slave for the database. To start slave replication, use the
<samp class="codeph">startSlave=true</samp> attribute and, optionally, the
<samp class="codeph">slaveHost=<em>hostname</em></samp> and
<samp class="codeph">slavePort=<em>portValue</em></samp> attributes. For example, for a
database named <samp class="codeph">wombat</samp>, you might use the following connection
URL:
<pre>jdbc:derby:wombat;startSlave=true</pre>
</li>

<li>Start master replication mode on the
<span>Derby</span> instance that is acting
as the master for the database. To start replication, connect to the database on
the master system using the <samp class="codeph">startMaster=true</samp> attribute in
conjunction with the <samp class="codeph">slaveHost=<em>hostname</em></samp> attribute (and,
optionally, the <samp class="codeph">slavePort=<em>portValue</em></samp> attribute). For
example, you might use the following connection URL:
<pre>jdbc:derby:wombat;startMaster=true;slaveHost=myremotesystem</pre>

A successful use of the <samp class="codeph">startMaster=true</samp> attribute will also
start the database.</li>

</ol>

<p>See the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for details about these
attributes.</p>

<p>After replication has been started, the slave is ready to receive logged
operations from the master. The master can now continue to process transactions.
From this point on, the master forwards all logged operations to the slave in
chunks. The slave repeats these operations by applying the contents of the
<span>Derby</span> transaction log, but
does not process any other operations. Attempts to connect to the slave database
are refused. In case of failure, the slave can recover to the state the master
was in at the time the last chunk of the transaction log was sent.</p>

<p>While replication is running, neither the slave or the master database is
permitted to be shut down. Replication must be stopped before you can shut down
either the slave or the master database. There is one exception to this rule:
if the entire system is shut down, the peer that is shut down notifies the other
replication peer that replication is stopped.</p>

<p>If you install jar files on the master system while replication is running,
the same jars are not automatically installed on the slave. But because the
transaction log information sent to the slave system includes the jar file
installation, the slave database has a record of the jar files, even though they
are not actually there. Therefore, you must install the jar files on the former
slave after a failover by calling either <samp class="codeph">SQLJ.remove_jar</samp>
followed by <samp class="codeph">SQLJ.install_jar</samp>, or
<samp class="codeph">SQLJ.replace_jar</samp>. (For information on installing jar files, see
"Loading classes from a database" in the 
<span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span> and
"System procedures for storing jar files in a database" in the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.)</p>

<p>If the jar files must be available to clients immediately after a failover,
you must stop replication and then start replication over again from the
beginning, so that the slave database will have the same jar files as the
master.</p>
