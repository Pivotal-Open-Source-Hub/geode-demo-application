<h1 class="topictitle1">Using JConsole to access the
<span>Derby</span> MBeans</h1>



<div><p>JConsole is a graphical JMX-compliant tool that is available in
recent versions of the Oracle JDKs. JConsole enables you to monitor and manage
Java applications and virtual machines on a local or remote machine.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>More information about JConsole is available in the OpenJDK project at
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/tools/svc/jconsole/index.html" target="_blank">http://openjdk.java.net/tools/svc/jconsole/index.html</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Starting JConsole and connecting to
<span>Derby</span></h2>
<p>In the Oracle JDK, the JConsole binary is available in
<samp class="codeph">JDK_HOME/bin</samp>, where JDK_HOME is the directory in which the JDK
is installed. To start JConsole, use the <samp class="codeph">jconsole</samp> command, as
in the following example on a UNIX system:</p>

<pre><strong>/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0/bin/jconsole</strong></pre>

<p>If you did not disable SSL when booting the managed JVM, you probably have
to provide a truststore containing the server's SSL certificate to be able to
establish JMX connections. If SSL client authentication is enabled, a keystore
must be configured as well (see
<a href="radminjmxenablepwdssl.html#radminjmxenablepwdssl">Enabling remote JMX with password authentication and SSL</a> for
details). The following example shows how to start JConsole with SSL client and
server authentication:</p>

<pre><strong>jconsole -J-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/home/user/.truststoreForClient
-J-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=myTruststorePassword
-J-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/home/user/.keystoreForClient
-J-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=myKeyStorePassword</strong></pre>

<p>A graphical user interface (GUI) appears. For additional startup options,
refer to the JConsole documentation. Once the GUI starts, you are presented with
a list of the JVMs that are accessible on the local host. Locate the JVM that is
running <span>Derby</span> and connect to
it.</p>

<p>To connect to a JVM on a remote host, you will need to supply the host name
and port number, or a JMX service URL, instead.</p>

<p>If you cannot find the
<span>Derby</span> JVM running on the
local host, make sure you are running JConsole as the same user as the
<span>Derby</span> JVM, or as a different
user with sufficient file system permissions.</p>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Accessing MBeans</h2>
<p>Once you have connected to a JVM via JConsole, the JVM's MBeans should be
available on a separate tab in the internal JConsole window. Under the domain
<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby</samp> you should see a list of MBeans. Browse the
MBeans and their attributes and operations by navigating the hierarchy
presented.</p>

<p>Another useful JConsole feature is that you can view dynamic data represented
as JMX attributes in graph form. To view these graphs, double-click an attribute
value that is a number.</p>
