<h1 class="topictitle1">Using custom Java code to access the
<span>Derby</span> MBeans</h1>



<div><p>In addition to using a tool like JConsole, you can also access the
<span>Derby</span> MBeans from a Java
application.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>How to do this may depend on how you configure the JVM that is running
<span>Derby</span>, how you configure user
authentication and authorization, or the host(s) from which you want to access
the MBeans.</p>

<p>This section has some example code to help you get started. You will find the
JMX classes you need in the packages <samp class="codeph">javax.management</samp> and
<samp class="codeph">javax.management.remote</samp>.</p>

<p>You do not need any <span>Derby</span>
libraries in the JMX client application's classpath (unless MBean proxies are
used).</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="radminjmxcode__connmbeanserver"><a name="radminjmxcode__connmbeanserver"><!-- --></a><h2 class="sectiontitle">Connecting to the MBean Server</h2>
<p><span>Derby</span> will attempt to
register its MBeans with the platform MBean server of the JVM running the
<span>Derby</span> system (embedded or
Network Server). The following examples assume that you have configured the
<span>Derby</span> JVM to enable remote
JMX, which means that you have set a port number
(<samp class="codeph">com.sun.management.jmxremote.port</samp>) to be used by the JMX
Server Connector.</p>

<p>The examples below assume that the port configured for remote JMX is 9999,
that the host name of the host running
<span>Derby</span> is
<samp class="codeph">example.com</samp>, and that this host is reachable from the
client host. (This host name is fictitious, and is used for example purposes
only.)</p>

<p>The following example code shows how to connect to the MBean Server when
JMX security has been disabled:</p>

<pre>    JMXServiceURL url = new JMXServiceURL(
            "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://example.com:9999/jmxrmi");
    JMXConnector jmxc = JMXConnectorFactory.connect(url, null);
    MBeanServerConnection mbeanServerConn = 
        jmxc.getMBeanServerConnection();</pre>

<p>The following code shows how to connect to the MBean server when JMX
password authentication is enabled (the default):</p>

<pre>    JMXServiceURL url = new JMXServiceURL(
            "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://example.com:9999/jmxrmi");
    // Assuming the following JMX credentials: 
    //  username=controlRole, password=derby
    String[] credentials = new String[] { "controlRole" , "derby" };
    HashMap&lt;String,Object&gt; env = new HashMap&lt;String,Object&gt;();
    // Set credentials (jmx.remote.credentials, 
    //  see JMX Remote API 1.0 spec section 3.4)
    env.put(JMXConnector.CREDENTIALS, credentials);
    // if the server's RMI registry is protected with SSL/TLS
    //  (com.sun.management.jmxremote.registry.ssl=true), the following
    //  entry must be included:
    //env.put("com.sun.jndi.rmi.factory.socket", 
    //    new SslRMIClientSocketFactory());  // uncomment if needed

    // Connect to the server
    JMXConnector jmxc = JMXConnectorFactory.connect(url, env);
    MBeanServerConnection mbeanServerConn = 
        jmxc.getMBeanServerConnection();</pre>

<div class="p"><div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>Not specifying <samp class="codeph">SslRMIClientSocketFactory</samp> when required
may result in the error message <samp class="codeph">java.rmi.ConnectIOException: non-JRMP
server at remote endpoint</samp>.</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Creating a ManagementMBean</h2>
<p>The only <span>Derby</span> MBean that
can be created by a JMX client is the <samp class="codeph">ManagementMBean</samp>. This
MBean is useful for controlling
<span>Derby</span> management (for
example, enabling and disabling management or MBeans), and to obtain information
such as the system identifier (which may be needed to specify MBeans later).</p>

<p>If you create such an MBean from your application, and if
<span>Derby</span> has already registered
a <samp class="codeph">ManagementMBean</samp> instance, the new MBean cannot have the same
object name as the <samp class="codeph">ManagementMBean</samp> already registered with the
server. It is therefore recommended to use a different object name domain
(that is, different from <samp class="codeph">example.com</samp>) and/or a different
<samp class="codeph">type</samp> key property value (different from
<samp class="codeph">Management</samp>).</p>

<p>The following example code shows how to create and register a new
<samp class="codeph">ManagementMBean</samp> with the MBean server:</p>

<pre>    ObjectName mgmtObjName = new ObjectName("com.example.app", 
                   "type", "DerbyManagement");
    try {
        ObjectInstance mgmtObj = 
            mbeanServerConn.createMBean("example.com.mbeans.Management", 
                mgmtObjName);
    } catch (InstanceAlreadyExistsException e) {
        // A management MBean with this object name already exists!
    }</pre>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Activating
<span>Derby</span> management</h2>
<p><span>Derby</span> attempts to activate
its JMX management service by default, so it will usually be active unless you
explicitly deactivate it, providing that
<span>Derby</span> has permissions to
perform the activation. If
<span>Derby</span> management is not
active, you will not be able to access any MBeans except the
<samp class="codeph">ManagementMBean</samp>.</p>

<p>By accessing the <samp class="codeph">ManagementActive</samp> attribute of the
<samp class="codeph">ManagementMBean</samp>, you can check whether the
<span>Derby</span> JMX management service
is active or not. The following example code performs this check and activates
the <span>Derby</span> management service
if it is not already active:</p>

<pre>    // assuming we already have a reference to the
    //  ManagementMBean's object name
    Boolean active = (Boolean) 
        mbeanServerConn.getAttribute(mgmtObjName, "ManagementActive");
    if (!active.booleanValue()) {
        // start management
        mbeanServerConn.invoke(mgmtObjName, "startManagement", 
            new Object[0], new String[0]);
    }</pre>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Obtaining the system identifier</h2>
<p>The system identifier is a unique <samp class="codeph">String</samp> that distinguishes
one running <span>Derby</span> system from
another. All MBeans that are instantiated by
<span>Derby</span> include the system
identifier in their object names.</p>

<p>One way to access an MBean is to fully specify its object name when
contacting the MBean server. For this, you need to know the current system
identifier. (Alternative ways to access MBeans include querying the MBean server
for all MBeans, or for MBeans whose object names match a specific pattern.)</p>

<p>The following example shows how to obtain the system identifier by accessing
a <samp class="codeph">ManagementMBean</samp>:</p>

<pre>    // assuming we already have a reference to the 
    //  ManagementMBean's object name
    String systemID = (String) mbeanServerConn.getAttribute(mgmtObjName, 
        "SystemIdentifier");</pre>

<p>The following example shows how to obtain the system identifier from a
<span>Derby</span> MBean's object
name:</p>

<pre>    // assuming we already have a reference to the ObjectName
    //  of an MBean registered by <span>Derby</span>, for example the
    //  <span>Derby</span>-registered ManagementMBean
    String systemID = derbyMgmtObjectName.getKeyProperty("system");</pre>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Accessing a specific
<span>Derby</span>-registered MBean</h2>
<p>In the previous examples, you have already seen how to read a single MBean
attribute, and how to invoke an MBean operation. In order to do this, you
usually need a reference to the MBean's <samp class="codeph">ObjectName</samp>.</p>

<p>If you consult the public API documentation for the
<span>Derby</span> MBeans 
and obtain the system identifier of the
<span>Derby</span> system you are
accessing through JMX, you have all the information you need to be able to
instantiate a <samp class="codeph">javax.management.ObjectName</samp> object directly, by
fully specifying its <samp class="codeph">String</samp> representation (see the
<samp class="codeph">ObjectName</samp> API documentation for details).</p>

<p>The following example code shows how to obtain a reference to the
<samp class="codeph">VersionMBean</samp> for <samp class="codeph">derby.jar</samp>:</p>

<pre>    // Assuming we already know the system identifier 
    // (see examples above), systemID.
    // A list of key properties is available is each MBean's Javadoc API.
    Hashtable&lt;String, String&gt; keyProps = new Hashtable&lt;String, String&gt;();
    keyProps.put("type", "Version");
    keyProps.put("jar", "derby.jar");
    keyProps.put("system", systemID);
    // MBeans registered by <span>Derby</span> always belong to the 
    //  "org.apache.derby" domain
    ObjectName versionObjectName = 
        new ObjectName("org.apache.derby", keyProps);

    // we can now use the object name to read an attribute
    String versionString = 
        (String) mbeanServerConn.getAttribute(versionObjectName, 
            "VersionString");
    System.out.println("VersionString: " + versionString);</pre>

<p>The output would look something like this:</p>

<pre>VersionString: 10.9.1.1 - (1305115)</pre>
