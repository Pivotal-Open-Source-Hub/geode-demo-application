<div><p>There are several ways to embed
<span>Derby</span> in a server framework.
</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Use the Network Server</dt>

<dd>This is the easiest way to provide connectivity to multiple users who
are accessing <span>Derby</span> databases
from different JVMs. The <span>Derby</span> Network
Server provides this kind of connectivity to <span>Derby</span> databases
within a single system or over a network.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Purchase another server framework</dt>

<dd>You can use <span>Derby</span> within
many server frameworks, such as IBM WebSphere Application Server.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Write your own framework</dt>

<dd><span>Derby</span>'s flexibility
allows other configurations as well. For example, rather than embedding <span>Derby</span> in a server that communicates
with a client that uses JDBC, you can embed <span>Derby</span> within
a servlet in a web server that communicates with a browser using HTTP.</dd>
