<h1 class="topictitle1"><span>Derby</span> in a server
framework</h1>



<div><p>In a sense, <span>Derby</span>
is always an embedded product. You can embed it in an application in which users
access the database from a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM), or you can embed
it in a server framework (an application that allows users from different JVMs
to connect to <span>Derby</span>
simultaneously).</p>

<p>When <span>Derby</span> is embedded
in an application, the local JDBC driver calls the local
<span>Derby</span> database.</p>

<p>When <span>Derby</span> is embedded
in a server framework, the server framework's connectivity software provides
data to multiple client JDBC applications over a network or the Internet.</p>

<p>For local or remote multi-user connectivity (multiple users who access <span>Derby</span> from different JVMs),
use the <span>Derby</span> Network
Server. If you require features that are not included in the Network Server,
you can embed the basic <span>Derby</span>
product in another server framework.</p>

There are several ways to embed Derby in a server framework.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminov33597.html">Multiple-client features available in Derby</a></strong><br />
Derby contains some features that are useful for developing multi-user applications.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminov825266.html">The Derby Network Server</a></strong><br />
The Derby Network Server provides multi-user connectivity to Derby databases within a single system or over a network.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminov825149.html">Embedded servers</a></strong><br />
Because Derby is written in the Java programming language, you have great flexibility in how you choose to configure your deployment.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminembeddedserver.html">How to start an embedded server from an application</a></strong><br />
In one thread, the embedding application starts the local JDBC driver for its own access.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="radminembeddedserverex.html">Embedded server example</a></strong><br />
You can start the Network Server in another thread automatically when Derby starts by setting the derby.drda.startNetworkServer property, or you can start it by using a program.</li>
