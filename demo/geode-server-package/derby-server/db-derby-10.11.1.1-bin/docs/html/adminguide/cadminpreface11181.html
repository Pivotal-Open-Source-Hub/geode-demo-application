<h1 class="topictitle1">Purpose of this guide</h1>



<div><p>This guide explains how to use
<span>Derby</span> in a multiple-client
environment. It also provides information that a server administrator might need
to keep <span>Derby</span> running with a
high level of performance and reliability in a server framework or in a
multiple-client application server environment.</p>

<p>When running in embedded mode,
<span>Derby</span> databases typically do
not need any administration.</p>

<p>To connect multiple clients with <span>Derby</span>, you can embed <span>Derby</span> in a server
framework that you choose, or you can use the <span>Derby</span> Network Server. This
guide describes these options.</p>
