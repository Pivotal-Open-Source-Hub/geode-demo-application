<h1 class="topictitle1">Using the backup procedures to perform an online backup</h1>



<div><p>Use the <samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE</samp> procedure
or one of the other system backup procedures to perform an online backup of a
database to a specified location.</p>

<p>The backup procedures are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE</samp></li>

<li><samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_NOWAIT</samp></li>

<li><samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_AND_ENABLE_LOG_ARCHIVE_MODE</samp></li>

<li><samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_AND_ENABLE_LOG_ARCHIVE_MODE_NOWAIT</samp></li>

</ul>

<p>Use the
<samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_AND_ENABLE_LOG_ARCHIVE_MODE</samp> or
<samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_AND_ENABLE_LOG_ARCHIVE_MODE_NOWAIT</samp>
procedure if you want to make it possible to perform a roll-forward recovery of
a damaged database. See
<a href="cadminrollforward.html#cadminrollforward">Roll-forward recovery</a> for details.</p>

<p>The <samp class="codeph">NOWAIT</samp> versions of the procedures do not wait for
transactions in progress with unlogged operations to complete before proceeding
with the backup; instead, they return an error immediately.</p>

<p>See the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for details about these
system procedures.</p>

<p>All four of these system procedures take a string argument that represents
the location in which to back up the database. Typically, you provide the full
path to the backup directory. (Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the
current directory, not to the <samp class="codeph">derby.system.home</samp> directory.)</p>

<p>For example, to specify a backup location of
<samp class="codeph">c:/mybackups/2012-04-01</samp> for a database that is currently open,
use the following statement (forward slashes are used as path separators in SQL
commands):</p>

<pre><strong>CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE('c:/mybackups/2012-04-01')</strong></pre>

<p>The <samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE</samp> or
<samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_NOWAIT</samp> procedure puts the
database into a state in which it can be safely copied. The procedure then
copies the entire original database directory (including data files, online
transaction log files, and jar files) to the specified backup directory. Files
that are not within the original database directory (for example,
<samp class="codeph">derby.properties</samp>) are <em>not</em> copied. With the exception of
a few cases mentioned in
<a href="cadminhubbkup01.html#cadminhubbkup01__hubbkupunlogged">Unlogged Operations</a>,
the procedure does not block concurrent transactions at any time.</p>

<p>A backup made with the
<samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_AND_ENABLE_LOG_ARCHIVE_MODE</samp> or
<samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_AND_ENABLE_LOG_ARCHIVE_MODE_NOWAIT</samp>
procedure is not a full copy of the database, but depends on the log files
created in the database since the backup. An attempt to access the backup
directly will invalidate the backup. The result could include a corrupted
database, missing data, errors during a subsequent attempt at restoring the
database, or database corruption errors encountered only once the restored
database is being used. The only supported way to access this kind of backup is
to restore the database as documented in
<a href="cadminrollforward.html#cadminrollforward">Roll-forward recovery</a>.</p>

<p>The following example shows how to back up a database to a directory with
a name that reflects the current date:</p>

<pre>public static void backUpDatabase(Connection conn) 
        throws SQLException {
    <strong>// Get today's date as a string:</strong>
    java.text.SimpleDateFormat todaysDate = 
        new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
    String backupdirectory = "c:/mybackups/" +
        todaysDate.format((java.util.Calendar.getInstance()).getTime());

    CallableStatement cs =
        conn.prepareCall("CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE(?)"); 
    cs.setString(1, backupdirectory);
    cs.execute(); 
    cs.close();
    System.out.println("backed up database to " + backupdirectory);
}</pre>

<p>For a database that was backed up on 2012-04-01, the previous commands
copy the current database to a directory of the same name in
<samp class="codeph">c:/mybackups/2012-04-01</samp>.</p>

<p>Uncommitted transactions do not appear in the backed-up database.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>Do not back up different databases with the same name to the same backup
directory. If a database of the same name already exists in the backup directory,
it is assumed to be an older version and is overwritten.</div>

<div class="section" id="cadminhubbkup01__hubbkupunlogged"><a name="cadminhubbkup01__hubbkupunlogged"><!-- --></a><h2 class="sectiontitle">Unlogged Operations</h2>
<p>For some operations, <span>Derby</span>
does not log because it can keep the database consistent without logging the
data.</p>

<p>The <samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE</samp> procedure will issue an
error if there are any unlogged operations in the same transaction as the backup
procedure.</p>

<p>If any unlogged operations are in progress in other transactions in the
system when the backup starts, this procedure will block until those
transactions are complete before performing the backup.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> automatically
converts unlogged operations to logged mode if they are started while the backup
is in progress (except operations that maintain application jar files in the
database). Procedures to install, replace, and remove jar files in a database
are blocked while the backup is in progress.</p>

<p>If you do not want backup to block until unlogged operations in other
transactions are complete, use the
<samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_BACKUP_DATABASE_NOWAIT</samp> procedure. This
procedure issues an error immediately at the start of the backup if there are
any transactions in progress with unlogged operations, instead of waiting for
those transactions to complete.</p>

<p>Unlogged operations include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Index creation.
<p>Only CREATE INDEX is logged, not all the data inserts into the index. The
reason inserts into the index are not logged is that if there is a failure, it
will just drop the index.</p>

<p>If you create an index when the backup is in progress, it will be slower,
because it has to be logged.</p>

<p>Foreign keys and primary keys create backing indexes. Adding those keys to an
existing table with data will also run slower.</p>

</li>

<li>Importing to an empty table or replacing all the data in a table.
<p>In this case also, data inserts into the table are not logged. Internally,
<span>Derby</span> creates a new table for
the import, changes the catalogs to point to the new table, and drops the
original table when the import completes.</p>

<p>If you perform such an import operation when backup is in progress, it will
be slower because data is logged.</p>

</li>

</ul>
