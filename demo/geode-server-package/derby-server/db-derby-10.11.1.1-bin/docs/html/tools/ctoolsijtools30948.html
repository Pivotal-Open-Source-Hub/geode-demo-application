<h1 class="topictitle1">Overview</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> is a
database management system (DBMS), accessed by applications through the JDBC
API. Included with the product are some standalone Java tools and utilities that
make it easier to use and develop applications for
<span>Derby</span>.</p>

<p>These tools and utilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><span />ij</em>
<p><samp class="codeph">ij</samp> is <span>Derby</span>'s
interactive JDBC scripting tool. It is a simple utility for running scripts
against a <span>Derby</span> database.
You can also use it interactively to run ad hoc queries. <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> provides
several commands for ease in accessing a variety of JDBC features.</p>
 <p><samp class="codeph">ij</samp> can
be used in an embedded or a client/server environment.</p>
</li>

<li><em><span />sysinfo</em> 
 <p><samp class="codeph">sysinfo</samp> provides information about your version of <span>Derby</span> and your environment.</p>
</li>

<li><em><span />dblook</em> 
 <p><samp class="codeph">dblook</samp> is <span>Derby</span>'s
Data Definition Language (DDL) Generation Utility, more informally called a schema dump
tool. It is a simple utility that dumps the DDL of a user-specified database
to either a console or a file. The generated DDL can then be used for such
things as recreating all or parts of a database, viewing a subset of a database's
objects (for example, those which pertain to specific tables and schemas),
or documenting a database's schema.</p>
</li>

<li><em><span />SignatureChecker</em>
<p>The <samp class="codeph">SignatureChecker</samp> tool identifies any SQL functions
and procedures in a database that do not follow the SQL Standard argument
matching rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
