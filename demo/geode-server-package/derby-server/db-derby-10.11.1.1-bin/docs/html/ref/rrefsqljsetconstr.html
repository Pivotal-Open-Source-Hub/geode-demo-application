<h1 class="topictitle1">SET CONSTRAINTS statement</h1>



<div><p>The SET CONSTRAINTS statement sets the deferrability of one or
more constraints.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>The SET CONSTRAINTS statement allows you to set the constraint mode for one
or more constraints either to DEFERRED or to IMMEDIATE.</p>

<p>When you use the statement to change a constraint from DEFERRED to
IMMEDIATE, the constraint is checked as soon as the statement is executed.</p>

<p>If the check fails, the transaction is not rolled back; an error here
constitutes a statement level error only. Therefore, you can use this statement
to check if all constraints are fulfilled before you attempt to commit the
transaction.</p>

<p>A SET CONSTRAINTS statement changes the state of a constraint only until the
transaction ends (or until another, overriding SET CONSTRAINTS statement is
issued). Once the transaction ends, the constraint reverts to the default
behavior declared for it at the time it was created (using a CREATE TABLE or
ALTER TABLE statement).</p>

<p>For more information on deferrable constraints, see
<a href="rrefsqlj13590.html">CONSTRAINT clause</a> and
<a href="rrefsqljconstrchar.html">constraintCharacteristics</a>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you use SET CONSTRAINTS on
<a href="rrefsqlj42154.html">table-level constraints</a>. If you use
SET CONSTRAINTS on a <a href="rrefsqlj16095.html">column-level
constraint</a>, you will need to find the name of the corresponding index by
performing queries against the system tables, which is cumbersome and requires
additional non-portable SQL.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>The SET CONSTRAINTS statement is valid only after a database has been fully
upgraded to <span>Derby</span>
Release 10.11 or higher. (See "Upgrading a database" in the
<span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span> for more information.) This
statement has no meaning in a database that is at Release 10.10 or lower.</div>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Syntax</h2> 
<pre><strong>SET CONSTRAINTS <em>constraintNameList</em> { DEFERRED | IMMEDIATE }</strong></pre>

<p>The <em>constraintNameList</em> is defined as follows:</p>

<pre><strong>ALL | <em><a href="rrefconstraintname.html">constraintName</a></em> [ { , <em>constraintName</em> }... ]</strong></pre>

</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Runtime behavior</h2>
<p>If the constraint mode is DEFERRED and a violation is seen at commit time,
an exception is thrown, and the transaction is rolled back.</p>

<p>When you change the constraint mode explicitly to IMMEDIATE using
SET CONSTRAINTS, the constraint is checked, but slightly differently from the
way it is checked at commit time: if a violation is found, a statement-level
exception is thrown. You can use this behavior to verify that constraints are
fulfilled before you attempt to commit.</p>

<p>If the constraint mode is IMMEDIATE upon entering a stored routine, and that
routine in a nested connection changes the constraint mode to DEFERRED, any
constraints that are affected are checked upon return from the routine. If the
check fails, an exception is thrown, and the transaction is rolled back.</p>

<p>Constraints with a constraint mode of DEFERRED are also checked if the
application calls <em>XAResource.prepare(Xid)</em>. If there is a violation,
<span>Derby</span> throws
<em>XAException.XA_RBINTEGRITY</em>, and the XA transaction is rolled back.</p>

SET CONSTRAINTS FOO, BAR IMMEDIATE;</strong></pre>
