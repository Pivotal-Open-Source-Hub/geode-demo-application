<h1 class="topictitle1">RIGHT OUTER JOIN operation</h1>



<div><p>A RIGHT OUTER JOIN is one of the JOIN operations that allow you to
specify a JOIN clause. It preserves the unmatched rows from the second (right)
table, joining them with a NULL in the shape of the first (left)
table.</p>

<div class="section"> <p>B LEFT OUTER JOIN A is equivalent to A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B, with the
columns in a different order.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Syntax</h2><pre><strong><em><a href="rreftableexpression.html#rreftableexpression">tableExpression</a></em> RIGHT [ OUTER ] JOIN <em><a href="rreftableexpression.html#rreftableexpression">tableExpression</a></em>
{
    ON <em><a href="rrefsqlj23075.html#rrefsqlj23075">booleanExpression</a></em> |
    <em><a href="rrefsqljusing.html#rrefsqljusing">USING clause</a></em>
}</strong></pre>


<p>The scope of expressions in the ON clause includes
the current tables and any tables in query blocks outer to the current SELECT.
 The ON clause can reference tables not being joined and does not have to
reference either of the tables being joined (though typically it does).</p>
 </div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example 1</h2> <pre><strong>-- get all countries and corresponding cities, including
-- countries without any cities</strong>

SELECT COUNTRIES.COUNTRY, CITIES.CITY_NAME 
FROM CITIES 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN COUNTRIES 
ON CITIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE = COUNTRIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE

<strong>-- get all countries in Africa and corresponding cities, including
-- countries without any cities
</strong>
SELECT COUNTRIES.COUNTRY, CITIES.CITY_NAME
FROM CITIES 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN COUNTRIES 
ON CITIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE = COUNTRIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE
WHERE Countries.region = 'Africa'

<strong>-- use the synonymous syntax, RIGHT JOIN, to achieve exactly
-- the same results as in the example above
</strong>
SELECT COUNTRIES.COUNTRY, CITIES.CITY_NAME
FROM CITIES 
RIGHT JOIN COUNTRIES 
ON CITIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE = COUNTRIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE
WHERE Countries.region = 'Africa'
</pre>
 </div>

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example 2</h2><pre><strong>-- a tableExpression can be a join operation. Therefore
-- you can have multiple join operations in a FROM clause
-- List every employee number and last name 
-- with the employee number and last name of their manager
</strong>
SELECT E.EMPNO, E.LASTNAME, M.EMPNO, M.LASTNAME	
	FROM EMPLOYEE E RIGHT OUTER JOIN	
	DEPARTMENT RIGHT OUTER JOIN EMPLOYEE M 
        ON MGRNO = M.EMPNO
        ON E.WORKDEPT = DEPTNO</pre>
