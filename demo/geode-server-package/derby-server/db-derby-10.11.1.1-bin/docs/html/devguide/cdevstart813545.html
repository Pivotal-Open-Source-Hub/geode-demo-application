<div><p>Your installation contains executable script files that simplify
invoking the <span>Derby</span> tools.
On UNIX systems, these files might need to have their default protections
set to include execute privilege.</p>

<p>A typical way to do this is with the command <em>chmod +x *.ksh</em>.</p>

<p>Consult the documentation for your operating system for system-specific
details.</p>
