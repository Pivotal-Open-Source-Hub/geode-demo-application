<h1 class="topictitle1">Purpose of this guide</h1>



<div><p>This guide explains how to use the core <span>Derby</span> technology
and is for developers building <span>Derby</span> applications.</p>

<p>It describes basic <span>Derby</span> concepts,
such as how you create and access <span>Derby</span> databases
through JDBC routines and how you can deploy <span>Derby</span> applications.</p>

<p>When an application embeds
<span>Derby</span>, application users take
on the role of database administrator and must maintain the integrity of the
database. See "Part Two:
<span>Derby</span> Administration Guide"
in the <span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span> for
information on administrative tasks such as backing up and restoring
databases. In particular, see the topic "Maintaining database integrity" for
information on preventing database corruption. You will need to make this
information available to users of your application.</p>
