<h1 class="topictitle1">Upgrading a database</h1>



<div><p>To upgrade a database, you must explicitly request an upgrade the
first time you connect to the database with the new version of <span>Derby</span>.</p>

<div class="p">Ensure that you <a href="tdevpreupgrade.html">complete the prerequisite
steps</a> before you upgrade:<ul>
<li>Back up your database before you upgrade.</li>

<li>Ensure that only the new <span>Derby</span> jar
files are in your CLASSPATH.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"> <div class="p">When you upgrade the database, you can perform a full upgrade
or soft upgrade:<ul>
<li>A full upgrade is a complete upgrade of the <span>Derby</span> database.
When you perform a full upgrade, you cannot connect to the database with an
older version of <span>Derby</span> and
you cannot revert back to the previous version. Elsewhere in the documentation,
when the term "upgrade" is used without any qualification, it means a full
upgrade.</li>

<li>A soft upgrade allows you to run a newer version of <span>Derby</span> against
an existing database without having to fully upgrade the database. This means
that you can continue to run an older version of <span>Derby</span> against
the database. However, if you perform a soft upgrade, certain features will
not be available to you until you perform a full upgrade. Specifically, new
features that affect the structure of a database are not available with a soft
upgrade. For a list of the new features in a release, see the Release Notes for
that release.</li>

</ul>

<div class="p"><span>To upgrade the database, select the type of upgrade that you want
to perform. The following table shows the upgrade types. In both examples,
<samp class="codeph">sample</samp> is a database from a previous version of
<span>Derby</span>.</span>
