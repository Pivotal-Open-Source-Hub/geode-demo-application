<h1 class="topictitle1">Notes on dynamic changes</h1>



<div><p>Remember the following items when you make dynamic changes to jar
files or to the classpath.</p>

<ul>
<li>When you are changing the <em>derby.database.classpath</em> property, all
classes loaded from database jar files are reloaded, even for a jar file that
has not changed.</li>

<li>Remember that the user's classpath is searched first.</li>

<li>Any existing prepared statements will use the previously loaded classes
unless they require class loading, in which case they will fail with a
<em>ClassNotFound</em> error.</li>

<li>Cached objects do not match objects created with newly loaded classes.
For example, an in-memory <em>Customer</em> object will not match a new
<em>Customer</em> object if the <em>Customer</em> class has been reloaded, and it
will raise a <em>ClassCastException</em>.</li>

</ul>
