<h1 class="topictitle1">Scope of properties</h1>



<div><p>You use properties to configure a
<span>Derby</span> system, database, or
conglomerate.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>system-wide</em>  
<p>Most properties can be set on a <em>system-wide</em> basis; that is, you set a
property for the entire system and all its databases and conglomerates, if this
is applicable. Some properties, such as error handling and automatic booting,
can be configured only in this way, since they apply to the entire system. (For
information about the <span>Derby</span>
system, see <a href="cdevdvlp27610.html#cdevdvlp27610">Derby system</a>.)</p>
</li>

<li><em>database-wide</em>  
<p>Some properties can also be set on a <em>database-wide</em> basis. That is, the
property is true for the selected database only and not for the other databases
in the system unless it is set individually within each of them.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>For properties that affect conglomerates, changing the value of such
properties affects only conglomerates that are created after the change.
Conglomerates created earlier are unaffected.</p>

<div class="p"><div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>Database-wide properties are stored in the database and are simpler for
deployment, in the sense that they follow the database. System-wide properties can be more practical during the development
process.</div>
