<h1 class="topictitle1">Conventions for specifying the database path name</h1>



<div><p>When you access databases from the file system (instead of from
the classpath or a jar file), any path name that is not absolute is interpreted
as relative to the system directory.</p>

<p>The path name must do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refer to a previously created
<span>Derby</span> database</li>

<li>Specify the <em>create=true</em> attribute</li>

</ul>

<p>The path separator in the path name is a forward slash (<samp class="codeph">/</samp>),
even in Windows path names. The path name cannot contain a colon
(<samp class="codeph">:</samp>), except for the colon after the drive name in a Windows
path name. See "Syntax of database connection URLs for applications with
embedded databases" in the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for the
full syntax.</p>

<p>You can specify only databases that are local to the machine on which the
JVM is running. NFS file systems on UNIX and remote shared files on Windows
(//<em>machine/directory</em>) are not guaranteed to work. Using <em>derby.system.home</em> and
forward slashes is recommended practice for platform independent applications.</p>

<p>If two different database path name values, relative or absolute, refer to
the same actual directory, they are considered equivalent. This means that
connections to a database through its absolute path name and its relative path
name are connections to the same database. Within
<span>Derby</span>, the name of the
database is defined by the canonical path of its directory from
<em>java.io.File.getCanonicalPath</em>.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> automatically
creates any intermediate directory that does not already exist when creating
a new database. If it cannot create the intermediate directory, the database
creation fails.</p>
