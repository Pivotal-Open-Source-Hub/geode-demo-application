<h1 class="topictitle1">Using auto-commit</h1>



<div><p>A new connection to a <span>Derby</span> database
is in auto-commit mode by default, as specified by the JDBC standard.</p>

<p>Auto-commit mode means that when a statement is completed, the method <em>commit</em> is
called on that statement automatically. Auto-commit in effect makes every
SQL statement a transaction. The commit occurs when the statement completes
or the next statement is executed, whichever comes first. In the case of a
statement returning a forward only <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp>, the statement completes
when the last row of the <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp> has been retrieved
or the <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp> has been closed explicitly. In the case
of a statement returning a scrollable <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp>, the
statement completes only when the <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet</em></samp> has been
closed explicitly.</p>

<p>Some applications might prefer to work with <span>Derby</span> in
auto-commit mode; some might prefer to work with auto-commit turned off. You
should be aware of the implications of using either model.</p>

<p>You should be aware of the following when you use auto-commit:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Cursors</em>   <p>You cannot use auto-commit if you do any positioned
updates or deletes (that is, an update or delete statement with a WHERE CURRENT
OF clause) on cursors which have the
<samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT</em></samp> holdability value
set.</p>
<p>Auto-commit automatically closes cursors that are
explicitly opened with the
<samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT</em></samp> value, when you do any
in-place updates or deletes.</p>
<p>An updatable cursor declared to be held
across commit (this is the default value) can execute updates and issue multiple
commits before closing the cursor. After an explicit or implicit commit, a
holdable forward-only cursor must be repositioned with a call to the
<samp class="codeph"><em>next</em></samp> method before it can accessed again. In this state,
the only other valid operation besides calling <samp class="codeph"><em>next</em></samp> is
calling <samp class="codeph"><em>close</em></samp>.</p>
</li>

<li><em>Database-side JDBC routines (routines using nested connections)</em> 
<p>You cannot execute functions within SQL statements if those functions
perform a commit or rollback on the current connection. Since in auto-commit
mode all SQL statements are implicitly committed, <span>Derby</span> turns
off auto-commit during execution of database-side routines and turns it
back on when the statement completes.</p>
<p>Routines that use nested connections
are not permitted to turn auto-commit on or off.</p>
</li>

<li><em>Table-level locking and the SERIALIZABLE isolation level</em>   <p>When
an application uses table-level locking and the SERIALIZABLE isolation level,
all statements that access tables hold at least shared table locks. Shared
locks prevent other transactions that update data from accessing the table.
A transaction holds a lock on a table until the transaction commits. <em>So
even a SELECT statement holds a shared lock on a table until its connection
commits and a new transaction begins. </em></p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>The following table summarizes how applications behave with auto-commit on
or off.</p>
