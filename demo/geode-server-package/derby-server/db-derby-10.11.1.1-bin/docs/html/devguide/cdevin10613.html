<div><p><span>Derby</span> offers
support for locales.</p>

<p>The word <em>locale</em> in the Java platform refers to an instance of a
class that identifies a particular combination of language and region. If
a Java class varies its behavior according to <em>locale</em>, it is said to
be locale-sensitive. <span>Derby</span>
provides some support for locales for databases and for other components, such
as the tools and the installer.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> also provides a
feature to support databases in many different languages, a feature which is
independent of a particular locale. When you create or upgrade a database, you
can use the <em>territory=ll_CC</em> attribute to associate a non-default locale
with the database. For information on how to use the <em>territory=ll_CC</em>
attribute, see the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>

A character set is a set of symbols and encodings. Character data types are represented as Unicode 2.0 sequences in Derby. Collation defines how character data is sorted.</li>
