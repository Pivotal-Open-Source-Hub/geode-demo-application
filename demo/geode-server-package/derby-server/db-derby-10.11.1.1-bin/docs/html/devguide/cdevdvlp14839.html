<h1 class="topictitle1">Application development overview</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> application
developers use the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API, the application
programming interface that makes it possible
to access relational databases from Java programs.</p>

<p>The JDBC API is part of the Java Platform, Standard Edition and is
not specific to <span>Derby</span>.
It consists of the <em>java.sql</em> and <em>javax.sql</em> packages, which is
a set of classes and interfaces that make it possible to access databases
(from a number of different vendors, not just <span>Derby</span>)
from a Java application.</p>

<p>To develop <span>Derby</span> applications
successfully, you will need to learn the JDBC API. This section does not teach you
how to program with the JDBC API.</p>

<p>This section covers the details of application programming that are specific
to <span>Derby</span> applications.
For example, all JDBC applications typically start their DBMS's JDBC driver
and use a connection URL to connect to a database. This section gives you
the details of how to start <span>Derby</span>'s
JDBC driver and how to work with <span>Derby</span>'s
connection URL to accomplish various tasks. It also covers essential <span>Derby</span> concepts
such as the <span>Derby</span> system.</p>

<p>You will find reference information about the particulars of <span>Derby</span>'s
implementation of the JDBC API in the <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>. </p>

<p><span>Derby</span> application developers
will need to learn SQL. <em>SQL</em> is the standard query language used with
relational databases and is not tied to a particular programming language.
No matter how a particular RDBMS has been implemented, the user can design
databases and insert, modify, and retrieve data using the standard SQL statements
and well-defined data types.</p>

<p>SQL is standardized by ANSI and ISO;
<span>Derby</span> supports entry-level
SQL as well as some higher-level features. Entry-level SQL is a subset of the
full SQL specified by ANSI and ISO that is supported by nearly all major DBMSs
today.</p>

<p>This section does not teach you SQL. You will find reference information
about the particulars of
<span>Derby</span>'s implementation of SQL
in the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> implements the JDBC
API so as to allow <span>Derby</span> to
serve as a resource manager in a Java EE compliant system.</p>

<p>When an application embeds
<span>Derby</span>, application users take
on the role of database administrator and must maintain the integrity of the
database. See "Part Two:
<span>Derby</span> Administration Guide"
in the <span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span> for
information on administrative tasks such as backing up and restoring
databases. In particular, see the topic "Maintaining database integrity" for
information on preventing database corruption. You will need to make this
information available to your users.</p>
