<h1 class="topictitle1">Derby JDBC database connection URL</h1>



<div><p>A Java application using the JDBC API establishes a connection
to a database by obtaining a <em>Connection</em> object.</p>

<p>The standard way to obtain a <em>Connection</em> object is to call the method
<em>DriverManager.getConnection</em>, which takes a <em>String</em> containing a
connection URL (uniform resource locator). A JDBC connection URL provides a way
of identifying a database. It also allows you to perform a number of high-level
tasks, such as creating a database or shutting down the system.</p>

<p>The following example shows the use of the connection URL:</p>

<pre>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:sample");</pre>

<p>An application in an embedded environment uses a different connection URL
from that used by applications using the
<span>Derby</span> Network Server in a
client/server environment. See "Accessing the Network Server by using the
network client driver" in the <span><em>Derby Server and Administration Guide</em></span>
for more information.</p>

<p>However, all versions of the connection URL (which you can use for tasks
besides connecting to a database) have common features:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can specify the name of the database you want to connect to.</li>

<li>You can specify a number of attributes and values that allow you to
accomplish tasks.</li>

</ul>

<p>For more information about what you can specify with the
<span>Derby</span> connection URL, see
<a href="cdevdvlp34964.html#cdevdvlp34964">Connecting to databases</a>. For details on the
connection URL syntax, see "Syntax of database connection URLs for applications
with embedded databases" in the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.
For detailed reference information on connection URL attributes and values, see
"Setting attributes for the database connection URL" in the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>
