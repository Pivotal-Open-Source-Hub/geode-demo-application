<h1 class="topictitle1">Using Derby as a Java EE resource manager</h1>



<div><p>The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (the Java EE platform) is a
standard for development of enterprise applications based on reusable components
in a multi-tier environment. In addition to the features of the Java Platform,
Standard Edition (the Java SE platform), the Java EE platform adds support for
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology, the Java Persistence API, JavaServer
Faces technology, Java Servlet technology, JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology,
and many more. The Java EE platform architecture is used to bring together
existing technologies and enterprise applications in a single, manageable
environment.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> is a Java EE
platform conformant component in a distributed Java EE system. As such,
<span>Derby</span> is one part of a larger
system that includes, among other things, a JNDI server, a connection pool
module, a transaction manager, a resource manager, and user applications.
Within this system, <span>Derby</span> can
serve as the resource manager.</p>

<p>For more information on the Java EE platform, see
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/documentation/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/documentation/index.html</a>.
</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>This section does not show you how to use
<span>Derby</span> as a Resource Manager.
Instead, it provides details specific to
<span>Derby</span> that are not covered in
the specification. This information is useful to programmers developing other
modules in a distributed Java EE system, not to end-user application
developers.</div>

<p>In order to qualify as a resource manager in a Java EE system, the Java EE
platform requires three basic areas of support. These three areas of support
involve implementation of APIs and are described in "Java EE Compliance: Java
Transaction API and javax.sql Extensions" in the
<cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</p>

<p>This chapter describes the
<span>Derby</span> classes that implement
the APIs and provides some implementation-specific details.</p>

Derby provides two embedded variants of each DataSource interface defined by the JDBC API.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevresman89722.html">Getting a DataSource</a></strong><br />
Normally, you can simply work with the interfaces for javax.sql.DataSource, javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource, and javax.sql.XADataSource, as shown in the following examples.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevresman92946.html">Shutting down or creating a database</a></strong><br />
If you need to shut down or create a database, it is easiest just to work with the Derby-specific implementations of interfaces, as shown in these examples.</li>
