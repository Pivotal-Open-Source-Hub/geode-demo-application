<h1 class="topictitle1">Connecting to databases within the system</h1>



<div><p>The standard way to access databases in the file system is by
specifying the path name of the database. The path name can be either an
absolute path name or a path name relative to the system directory. In a
client/server environment, this path name is always on the <em>server</em>
machine.</p>

<p>By default, you can connect to databases within the current system directory
(see <a href="cdevdvlp13018.html#cdevdvlp13018">Defining the system directory</a>). To connect to
databases within the current system directory, just specify the base name of the
database on the connection URL. For example, if your system directory contains a
database called <em>myDB</em>, you can connect to that database with the following
connection URL:</p>

<pre>jdbc:derby:myDB</pre>

<p>The full method call within a Java program would be:</p>

<pre>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:derby:myDB");</pre>
