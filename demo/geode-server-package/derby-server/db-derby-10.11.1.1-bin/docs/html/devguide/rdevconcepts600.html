<h1 class="topictitle1">Example of threads sharing a statement</h1>



<div><p>This example shows what can happen if two threads try to share
a single<em> Statement</em>.</p>

<div class="example"> <pre>PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(
    "UPDATE account SET balance =  balance + ? WHERE id = ?");
<strong>/* now assume two threads T1,T2 are given this
java.sql.PreparedStatement object </strong>and that the following events
happen in the order shown (pseudojava code)*/
T1 - ps.setBigDecimal(1, 100.00);
T1 - ps.setLong(2, 1234);
T2 -  ps.setBigDecimal(1, -500.00);
<strong>// *** At this point the prepared statement has the parameters
// -500.00 and 1234
// T1 thinks it is adding 100.00 to account 1234 but actually
// it is subtracting 500.00</strong>
T1 - ps.executeUpdate();
T2 - ps.setLong(2, 5678);
<strong>// T2 executes the correct update</strong>
 T2 - ps.executeUpdate();
<strong>/* Also, the auto-commit mode of the connection can lead
to some strange behavior.*/</strong></pre>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>If it is absolutely necessary, the application can get around
this problem with Java synchronization.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><p>If the threads each obtain their own <em>PreparedStatement</em> (with
identical text), their <samp class="codeph"><em>setXXX</em></samp> calls do not interfere
with each other. Moreover, <span>Derby</span> is
able to share the same compiled query plan between the two statements; it
needs to maintain only separate state information. However, there is the potential
for confusion in regard to the timing of the <em>commit</em>, since a single <em>commit</em> commits
all the statements in a transaction.</p>
