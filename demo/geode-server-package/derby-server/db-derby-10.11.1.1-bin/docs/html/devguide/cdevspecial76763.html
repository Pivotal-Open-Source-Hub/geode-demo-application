<h1 class="topictitle1">Performing referential actions</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> provides
referential actions. Examples in this section are included to illustrate how
to write triggers.</p>

<p>You can choose to use standard SQL referential integrity (using foreign keys)
to obtain this functionality, rather than writing triggers. See the "CONSTRAINT
clause" topic in the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for
details.</p>
