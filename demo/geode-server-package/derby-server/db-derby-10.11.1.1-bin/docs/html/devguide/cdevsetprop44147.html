<h1 class="topictitle1">Making dynamic or static changes to properties</h1>



<div><p>Properties set in the <em>derby.properties</em> file and on the command
line of the application that boots
<span>Derby</span> are <em>always</em>
static, because <span>Derby</span> reads
this file and those parameters only at startup.</p>

<div class="p">Only properties set in the following ways have the potential to be dynamic:
<ul>
<li>As database-wide properties</li>

<li>As system-wide properties via a <em>Properties</em> object
in the application in which the
<span>Derby</span> engine is embedded</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>See the "<span>Derby</span> properties"
section of the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for information
about specific properties.</p>
