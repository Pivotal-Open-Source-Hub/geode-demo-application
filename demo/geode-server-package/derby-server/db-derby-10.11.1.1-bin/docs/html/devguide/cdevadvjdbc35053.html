JDBC's java.sql.Driver.getPropertyInfo method allows a generic GUI tool to determine the properties for which it should prompt a user in order to get enough information to connect to a database. Depending on the values the user has supplied so far, additional values might become necessary. It might be necessary to iterate though several calls to getPropertyInfo.</li>

When you use an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop an embedded Derby application, you might need to run Derby within a server framework.</li>
