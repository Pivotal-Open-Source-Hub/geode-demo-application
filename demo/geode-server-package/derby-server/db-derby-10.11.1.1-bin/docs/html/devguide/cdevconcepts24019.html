<h1 class="topictitle1">Multiple connections from a single application</h1>



<div><p>A single application can work with multiple <em>Connections</em> to
the same database and assign them to different threads.</p>

<p>You can avoid concurrency and deadlock problems in your application in
several ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the <em>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED</em> isolation level and turn on
row-level locking (the defaults).</li>

<li>Beware of deadlocks caused by using more than one <em>Connection</em> in
a single thread (the most obvious case). For example, if the thread tries
to update the same table from two different <samp class="codeph"><em>Connections</em></samp>,
a deadlock can occur.</li>

<li>Assign <em>Connections</em> to threads that handle discrete tasks. For example,
do not have two threads update the <em>Hotels</em> table. Have one thread update
the <em>Hotels</em> table and a different one update the <em>Groups</em> table.</li>

<li>If threads access the same tables, commit transactions often.</li>

<li>Multi-threaded Java applications have the ability to self-deadlock without
even accessing a database, so beware of that too.</li>

<li>Use nested connections to share the same lock space.</li>

</ul>
