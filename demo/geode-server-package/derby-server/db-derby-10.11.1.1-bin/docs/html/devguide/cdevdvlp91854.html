<h1 class="topictitle1">Accessing databases from the classpath</h1>



<div><p>In most cases, you access databases from the file system. However,
it is also possible to access databases from the classpath. The databases
can be archived into a jar or zip file or left as is.</p>

<p>All such databases are read-only.</p>

<p>To access an unarchived database from the classpath, use the
<em>classpath</em> subsubprotocol.</p>

<p>For example, for a database called <em>sample</em> in
<em>C:\<span>derby</span>\demo\databases</em>,
you can put the
<em>C:\<span>derby</span>\demo\databases</em>
directory in the classpath and access <em>sample</em> like this:</p>

<pre>
jdbc:derby:classpath:sample
</pre>

<p>If only <em>C:\<span>derby</span></em>
were in the classpath, you could access <em>sample</em> (read-only) like this:</p>

<pre>
jdbc:derby:classpath:demo/databases/sample
</pre>
