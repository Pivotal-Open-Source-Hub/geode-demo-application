<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating a customized collator</h1>



<div><p>You may need to define a collation order different from that of the
strengths provided by the <em>collation=collation</em> attribute.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>To define a new collation order, follow these steps.</p>

</div>

<ol>
<li>
<span>Create a class that extends the <em>java.text.spi.CollatorProvider</em>
class and that returns a collator that orders strings the way you want it
to.</span>
</li>

<li>
<span>Create a text file named
<em>META-INF/services/java.text.spi.CollatorProvider</em> that contains one line
with the name of your collator provider class.</span>
</li>

<li>
<span>Put the compiled class file and the text file in a jar file that you drop
into your JRE's <em>lib/ext</em> directory or in one of the directories specified
by the <em>java.ext.dirs</em> property.</span></li>

</ol>

<div class="example">
<p>For example, suppose you want to define a collation order to make Greek
characters sort near their Latin equivalents ('α' near 'a', ''β' near
'b', and so on). You could define another locale with a <em>CollatorProvider</em>
that returns a <em>java.text.RuleBasedCollator</em> with  ever rules you want.
See the API documentation for the <em>RuleBasedCollator</em> class for details
about how you specify rules. In its simplest form, a set of rules might look
like <samp class="codeph">"a,A &lt; b,B &lt; c,C"</samp>, which means more or less that
'a' and 'A' should be sorted before 'b' and 'B', which should be sorted before
'c' and 'C'. So to get the Greek characters sorted near similar Latin
characters, define a <em>CollatorProvider</em> that looks like this one:</p>

<pre>
public class MyCollatorProvider extends CollatorProvider {
    public Locale[] getAvailableLocales() {
        return new Locale[] {
            new Locale("en", "US", "greek")
        };
    }
    
    public Collator getInstance(Locale locale) {
        StringBuilder rules = new StringBuilder();
        // alpha should go between a and b
        rules.append("&lt; a,A &lt; \u03b1,\u0391 &lt; b,B");
        // beta should go between b and c
        rules.append("&amp; b,B &lt; \u03b2,\u0392 &lt; c,C");
        // add more rules here ....

        try {
            return new RuleBasedCollator(rules.toString());
        } catch (ParseException pe) {
            throw new Error(pe);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Again, put the compiled class and the
<em>META-INF/services/java.text.spi.CollatorProvider</em> file in a jar file, and
start the <samp class="codeph">ij</samp> tool with the <samp class="codeph">-Djava.ext.dirs=.</samp>
option in the directory where the jar file is located. Create a database that
uses the new locale and insert some data with both Greek and Latin
characters:</p>

<pre>
ij&gt; connect 'jdbc:derby:GreekDB;territory=en_US_greek;collation=TERRITORY_BASED;create=true';
ij&gt; create table t (x varchar(12));
0 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij&gt; insert into t values 'a', 'b', 'c', 'α', 'β';
5 rows inserted/updated/deleted
ij&gt; select * from t order by x;
X           
------------
a
α
b
β
c 

5 rows selected
</pre>

<p>The ordering is just as you wanted it, with the Greek characters between the
Latin ones, and not at the end where they would normally be located.</p>

<p>One word of caution: If, after you have created a database, you update your
custom <em>CollatorProvider</em> so that the ordering is changed, you will need
to recreate the database. You must do this because the indexes in the database
are ordered, and you may see strange results if the indexes are ordered with a
different collator from the one your database is currently using.</p>
