<h1 class="topictitle1">Multi-thread programming tips</h1>



<div><p>You may be sharing a <em>Connection</em> among multiple threads because
you have experienced poor concurrency using separate transactions.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for increasing concurrency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use row-level locking.</li>

<li>Use the <em>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED</em> isolation level.</li>

<li>Avoid queries that cannot use indexes; they require locking of all the
rows in the table (if only very briefly) and might block an update.</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, some programmers might share a statement among multiple threads
to avoid the overhead of each thread's having its own. Using the single statement
cache, threads can share the same statement from <em>different connections</em>.
For more information, see "Using the statement cache" in
<span><em>Tuning Derby</em></span>.</p>
