<h1 class="topictitle1">Locale-based collation</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span>
supports the ability to define collation rules that are appropriate to a
locale. This is referred to as <em><dfn class="term">locale-based collation</dfn></em>.
</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span>Derby</span> supports the locales
that the Java programming language supports. In addition, it is possible to
create customized locales. For details, see
<a href="tdevdvlpcustomcollation.html#tdevdvlpcustomcollation">Creating a customized collator</a>.</p>

<p>You can set the locale of a database when you create the database by
specifying the <em>territory=ll_CC</em> attribute. (See
<a href="tdevdvlpcollation.html#tdevdvlpcollation">Creating a database with locale-based collation</a>
for details.) If you do not specify a locale,
<span>Derby</span> uses
the default locale of the JVM in which the database is created.</p>

<p>At the same time, you can also specify locale-based collation by using the
<em>collation=collation</em> attribute, and you can specify a particular
collation strength to make the database either case-sensitive or
case-insensitive, or to respect both case and accent in collation. See
<a href="tdevdvlpcaseinscoll.html#tdevdvlpcaseinscoll">Creating a case-insensitive database</a> for
information on making the database use case-insensensitive searches.</p>

<p>Each JVM can support many locales that are independent of the default locale
for the JVM. Collation support for these additional locales is provided
through the <em>java.text.RuleBasedCollator</em> class and the set
of rules for these locales. Refer to the JVM specification for details
of how these rules are used to provide locale-specific collation.</p>

<p>The locale-based collation in
<span>Derby</span> affects
how the CHAR and VARCHAR data types are compared. Specifying locale-based
collation also impacts how the LIKE Boolean operator processes CHAR, VARCHAR,
CLOB, and LONG VARCHAR data.</p>

<p>Locale-based collation adds some extra processing overhead to all
character-based comparison operations.</p>
