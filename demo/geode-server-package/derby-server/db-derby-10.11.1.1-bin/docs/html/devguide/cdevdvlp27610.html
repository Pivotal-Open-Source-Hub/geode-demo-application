<h1 class="topictitle1">Derby system</h1>



<div><p>A <span>Derby</span> database
exists within a <em>system</em>.</p>

<p>A <span>Derby</span> system is a
single instance of the <span>Derby</span> database
engine and the environment in which it runs. It consists of a system directory,
zero or more databases, and a system-wide configuration. The system directory
contains any persistent system-wide configuration parameters, or properties,
specific to that system in a properties file called <a href="cdevdvlp39943.html#cdevdvlp39943">derby.properties</a>.
This file is not automatically created; you must create it yourself.</p>

<p>The <span>Derby</span> system is
not persistent; you must specify the location of the system directory at every
startup.</p>

<p>However, the <span>Derby</span> system
and the system directory is an essential part of a running database or databases.
Understanding the <span>Derby</span> system
is essential to successful development and deployment of <span>Derby</span> applications.
As the following figure shows,
<span>Derby</span> databases live in a
system, which includes system-wide properties, an error log, and one or more
databases.</p>

<div class="fignone" id="cdevdvlp27610__rdevdvlp17155"><a name="cdevdvlp27610__rdevdvlp17155"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Figure 1. Derby system</span>
<br /><img src="system_os.gif" alt="This figure shows a Derby system that includes a database called Accounting and a database called Sales. The figure shows the derby.system.home system variable pointing to the databases and explains that this system variable tells Derby the name of your system directory. Additionally, this figure shows that the derby.properties file and the derby.log file are part of the Derby system." /><br />
</div>

<p>The system directory can also contain an error log file called <em>derby.log </em>(see <a href="cdevdvlp25889.html#cdevdvlp25889">The error log</a>).</p>

<p>Each database within that system is contained in a subdirectory, which
has the same name as the database (see <a href="cdevdvlp21955.html#cdevdvlp21955">A Derby database</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, if you connect to a database outside the current system, it
automatically becomes part of the current system.</p>

<p>When you use the embedded driver,
<span>Derby</span> database files and log
files normally have whatever default permissions you specify for your file
system. If you are running with Java SE 7 or later, however, you can enhance
security by restricting file access to the user who creates the database. To do
this, set the system property <em>derby.storage.useDefaultFilePermissions</em> to
false. See the <span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for details.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevdvlp96597.html">One Derby instance for each Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a></strong><br />
You could potentially have two instances of a Derby system running on the same machine at the same time. Each instance must run in a different Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevdvlp27715.html">Booting databases</a></strong><br />
The default configuration for Derby is to boot (or start) a database when an application first makes a connection to it. When Derby boots a database, it checks to see if recovery needs to be run on the database, so in some unusual cases booting can take some time.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="tdevdvlp20349.html">Shutting down the system</a></strong><br />
In an embedded environment, when an application shuts down, it should first shut down Derby.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevdvlp13018.html">Defining the system directory</a></strong><br />
You define the system directory when Derby starts up by specifying a Java system property called derby.system.home.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevdvlp25889.html">The error log</a></strong><br />
Once you create or connect to a database within a system, Derby begins outputting information and error messages to the error log. Typically, Derby writes this information to a file called derby.log in the system directory.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevdvlp39943.html">derby.properties</a></strong><br />
The text file derby.properties contains the definition of properties, or configuration parameters that are valid for the entire system.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevdvlp20458.html">Double-booting system behavior</a></strong><br />
Derby prevents two instances of itself from booting the same database by using a file called db.lck inside the database directory.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevdvlp19297.html">Recommended practices</a></strong><br />
When developing Derby applications, create a single directory to hold your database or databases.</li>
