<h1 class="topictitle1">Pitfalls of sharing a connection among threads</h1>



<div><p>Here is a review of the potential pitfalls of sharing a single <em>Connection</em> among
multiple threads.</p>

<ul>
<li>Committing or rolling back a transaction closes all open <em>ResultSet</em> objects
and currently executing <em>Statements</em>, unless you are using held cursors. <p>If
one thread commits, it closes the <em>Statements</em> and <em>ResultSets</em> of
all other threads using the same connection.</p>
</li>

<li>Executing a <em>Statement</em> automatically closes any existing open <em>ResultSet</em> generated
by an earlier execution of that <em>Statement</em>. <p>If threads share <em>Statements</em>,
one thread could close another's <em>ResultSet.</em></p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>In many cases, it is easier to assign each thread to a distinct <em>Connection</em>.
If thread <em>A</em> does database work that is not transactionally related
to thread <em>B</em>, assign them to different <em>Connections</em>. For example,
if thread <em>A</em> is associated with a user input window that allows users
to delete hotels and thread <em>B</em> is associated with a user window that
allows users to view city information, assign those threads to different <em>Connections</em>.
That way, when thread <em>A</em> commits, it does not affect any <em>ResultSets</em> or <em>Statements</em> of
thread B.</p>

<p>Another strategy is to have one thread do queries and another thread do
updates. Queries hold shared locks until the transaction commits in SERIALIZABLE
isolation mode; use READ_COMMITTED instead.</p>

<p>Yet another strategy is to have only one thread do database access. Have
other threads get information from the database access thread.</p>

<p>Multiple threads are permitted to share a <em>Connection</em>, <em>Statement</em>,
or <em>ResultSet</em>. However, the application programmer must ensure that
one thread does not affect the behavior of the others.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Recommended Practices</h2><p>Here are some tips for avoiding
unexpected behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid sharing <em>Statements</em> (and their <samp class="codeph"><em>ResultSets</em></samp>)
among threads.</li>

<li>Each time a thread executes a<em> Statement</em>, it should process the
results before relinquishing the <samp class="codeph"><em>Connection</em></samp>.</li>

<li>Each time a thread accesses the <em>Connection</em>, it should consistently
commit or not, depending on application protocol.</li>

<li>Have one thread be the "managing" database <em>Connection</em> thread that
should handle the higher-level tasks, such as establishing the <samp class="codeph"><em>Connection</em></samp>,
committing, rolling back, changing <samp class="codeph"><em>Connection</em></samp> properties
such as auto-commit, closing the <samp class="codeph"><em>Connection</em></samp>, shutting
down the database (in an embedded environment), and so on.</li>

<li>Close <em>ResultSets</em> and <samp class="codeph"><em>Statements</em></samp> that are
no longer needed in order to release resources.</li>

</ul>
