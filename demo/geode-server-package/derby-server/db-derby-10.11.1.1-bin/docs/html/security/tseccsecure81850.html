<h1 class="topictitle1">Configuring security in an embedded environment</h1>



<div><p>In an embedded environment, typically there is only one database
per system, and there are no administrative resources to protect
databases.</p>

<div class="section">To configure security in an embedded environment:</div>

<ol>
<li><span>Encrypt the database when you create it.</span></li>

<li><span>Configure all security features as database-level properties. 
These properties are stored in the database (which is encrypted). See
"Scope of properties" and "Setting database-wide properties" in the
<span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span> for more information.</span>
</li>

<li><span>Turn on protection for database-level properties so that they cannot
be overridden by system properties by setting the
<samp class="codeph">derby.database.propertiesOnly</samp> property to true. See the
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span> for details on this
property.</span></li>

<li><span>To prevent unauthorized users from accessing databases once they
are booted, turn on user authentication and SQL authorization for the database.
Use NATIVE authentication or, alternatively, LDAP or a user-defined
class.</span></li>

<li><span>Configure Java security for your environment.</span></li>

</ol>

<div class="section"><p>The following figure shows how disk encryption protects data when the
recipient might not know how to protect data. It is useful for databases
deployed in an embedded environment.</p>
