<h1 class="topictitle1">Configuring SSL/TLS</h1>



<div><p>By default, network traffic travels in cleartext between
<span>Derby</span> clients and
servers.</p>

<p>By using a man-in-the-middle ploy, a clever attacker can read all of the
string data shipped to and from the server. By knowing the
<span>Derby</span> wire protocol, a clever
attacker can read numeric data too. Even worse, the man-in-the-middle can change
the data while it is traveling between the client and the server.</p>

<p>Fortunately, <span>Derby</span> can
encrypt network traffic using the SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer
Security) logic supplied with the virtual machine. As a side effect, SSL/TLS
raises an extra authentication hurdle too, involving
<em>peer authentication</em>.</p>

<p>The term <em>peer</em> is used for the other part of the server-client
communication: the server's peer is the client, and the client's peer is the
server.</p>

<p>SSL/TLS for <span>Derby</span> (both
for client and for server) operates in three possible modes:</p>

<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">off</dt>

<dd>The default, no SSL/TLS encryption</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">basic</dt>

<dd>SSL/TLS encryption, no peer authentication</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">peerAuthentication</dt>

<dd>SSL/TLS encryption and peer authentication</dd>


</dl>

<p>Peer authentication may be set on the server, on the client, or on both. Peer
authentication means that the other side of the SSL/TLS connection is
authenticated based on a trusted certificate installed locally.</p>

<p>Before using this encryption technology, you will want to familiarize
yourself with SSL/TLS concepts such as key pairs and certificates, and with the
JDK's <samp class="codeph">keytool</samp> application. You can find useful overviews of
SSL/TLS at Apache and Wikipedia
(<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/ssl/ssl_intro.html" target="_blank">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/ssl/ssl_intro.html</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer</a>, respectively). You can find <samp class="codeph">keytool</samp>
documentation for Unix and for Windows at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html</a> and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html" target="_blank">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>Network encryption requires the following setup steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Client certificates:</strong> Each client must generate a client key pair and
certificate. The client certificates must be loaded into the server's trust
store.</li>

<li><strong>Server certificate:</strong> The server must generate a server key pair and
certificate. All of the clients must load the server's certificate into their
respective trust stores.</li>

<li><strong>Server startup:</strong> The server must be booted with system properties and a
startup option that turn on SSL/TLS encryption.</li>

<li><strong>Client startup:</strong> The client must be started with system properties that turn
on SSL/TLS encryption. In addition, an extra attribute is added to the JDBC
connection URL.</li>

</ol>

<p>To use SSL/TLS to encrypt
<span>Derby</span>'s network traffic, the
client must have a key store for holding its own public/private key pair. The
client must also have a trust store for holding the server's certificate. If the
key store and trust store do not already exist, the <samp class="codeph">keytool</samp>
program will create them. Suppose that the client stores its public/private key
pair in <samp class="codeph">~/vault/ClientKeyStore</samp>, and suppose that the client
stores certificates from other systems in
<samp class="codeph">~/vault/ClientTrustStore</samp>.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="csecsslkeys.html">Key and certificate handling</a></strong><br />
For SSL operation, the server always needs a key pair. If the server runs in peer authentication mode (the server authenticates the clients), each client needs its own key pair. In general, if one end of the communication wants to authenticate its partner, the first end needs to install a certificate generated by the partner.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="csecsslserver.html">Starting the server with SSL/TLS</a></strong><br />
For server SSL/TLS, a server key pair needs to be generated. If the server is going to do client authentication, the client certificates need to be installed in the trust store.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="csecsslclient.html">Running the client with SSL/TLS</a></strong><br />
Basic SSL encryption on the client is enabled either by the URL attribute ssl, the property ssl, or the datasource attribute ssl set to basic.</li>

The other server commands (shutdown, ping, sysinfo, runtimeinfo, logconnections, maxthreads, timeslice, trace, and tracedirectory) are implemented as clients, and they behave exactly as clients with regards to SSL.</li>
