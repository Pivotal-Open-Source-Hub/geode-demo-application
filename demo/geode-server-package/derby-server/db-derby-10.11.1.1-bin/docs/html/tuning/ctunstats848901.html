<h1 class="topictitle1">How the optimizer determines the number of rows in a table</h1>



<div><p>The optimizer uses a stored row count to determine the number of rows
in a table. The stored row count is maintained automatically by the
system.</p>

<p>Normally, an updated value is stored in the database whenever the database
goes through an orderly shutdown (as long as the database is not read-only).
Stored row counts become inaccurate if there is a non-orderly shutdown (for
example, a power failure or other type of system crash).</p>

<p>You can correct the optimizer's row count without shutting down the system;
<span>Derby</span> sets the stored row
count for a table to the correct value whenever a query that does a full scan on
the base conglomerate finishes. For example, executing the following query sets
the row count for table <samp class="codeph">Flights</samp> to the correct value:</p>

<pre><strong>SELECT * FROM Flights</strong></pre>

<p><span>Derby</span> also sets the stored
row count on a table to the correct value whenever a user creates a new index or
a primary key, unique, or foreign key constraint on the table. This value is not
guaranteed to be written to disk.</p>
