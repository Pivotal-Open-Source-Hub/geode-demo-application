<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctundepth10525.html">Avoiding table scans of large tables</a></strong><br />
Derby is fast and efficient, but when tables are huge, scanning tables might take longer than a user would expect. It's even worse if you then ask Derby to sort this data.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctundepth29804.html">Avoiding compiling SQL statements</a></strong><br />
When you submit an SQL statement to Derby, Derby compiles and then executes the statement. Compilation is a time-consuming process that involves several steps, including optimization, the stage in which Derby makes its statement execution plan. A statement execution plan includes whether to use an index, the join order, and so on.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="ctundepth14326.html">Shielding users from Derby class-loading events</a></strong><br />
JVMs tend to load classes as they are needed, which means that the first time you need a class in a piece of software, it takes longer to use.</li>
