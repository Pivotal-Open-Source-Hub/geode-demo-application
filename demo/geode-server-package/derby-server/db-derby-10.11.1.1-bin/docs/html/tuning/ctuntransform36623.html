<h1 class="topictitle1">Predicates pushed into views or derived tables</h1>



<div><p>An SQL statement that references a view can also include a
predicate.</p>

<p>Consider the view <samp class="codeph">v2(a,b)</samp>:</p>

<pre><strong>CREATE VIEW v2(a,b) AS
SELECT sales_person, MAX(sales)
FROM Sales
GROUP BY sales_person</strong></pre>

<p>The following statement references the view and includes a predicate:</p>

<pre><strong>SELECT *
FROM v2
WHERE a = 'LUCCHESI'</strong></pre>

<p>When <span>Derby</span> transforms that
statement by first transforming the view into a derived table, it places the
predicate at the top level of the new query, outside the scope of the derived
table:</p>

<pre><strong>SELECT a, b 
FROM (SELECT sales_person, MAX(sales) 
   FROM Sales 
   WHERE sales_person = 'LUCCHESI' 
   GROUP BY sales_person) 
   v1(a, b)</strong></pre>

<p>In the example in <a href="ctuntransform22576.html">View flattening</a>,
<span>Derby</span> was able to flatten the
derived table into the main SELECT, so the predicate in the outer SELECT could
be evaluated at a useful point in the query. This is not possible in this
example, because the underlying view does not satisfy all the requirements of
view flattening.</p>

<p>However, if the source of all of the column references in a predicate is a
<a href="ctuntransform13966.html#ctuntransform13966__rtuntransform13785">simple
column reference</a> in the underlying view or table,
<span>Derby</span> is able to <em>push</em>
the predicate <em>down</em> to the underlying view. Pushing down means that the
qualification described by the predicate can be evaluated when the view is being
evaluated. In our example, the column reference in the outer predicate,
<samp class="codeph">a</samp>, in the underlying view is a simple column reference to the
underlying
<a href="ctuntransform13966.html#ctuntransform13966__rtuntransform41494">base
table</a>. So the final transformation of this statement after predicate
pushdown is:</p>

<pre><strong>SELECT a, b 
FROM (SELECT sales_person, MAX(sales) from Sales 
WHERE sales_person = 'LUCCHESI' 
GROUP BY sales_person) v1(a, b)</strong></pre>

<p>Without the transformation,
<span>Derby</span> would have to scan the
entire table <samp class="codeph">t1</samp> to form all the groups, only to throw out all
but one of the groups. With the transformation,
<span>Derby</span> is able to make that
qualification part of the derived table.</p>

<p>If there were a predicate that referenced column <samp class="codeph">b</samp>, it could
not be pushed down, because in the underlying view, column <samp class="codeph">b</samp> is
not a simple column reference.</p>

<p>Predicate pushdown transformation includes predicates that reference multiple
tables from an underlying join.</p>
