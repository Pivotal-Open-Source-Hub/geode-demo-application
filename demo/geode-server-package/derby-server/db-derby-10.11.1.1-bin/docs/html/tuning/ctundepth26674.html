<h1 class="topictitle1">Overview of RunTimeStatistics</h1>



<div><p>When RUNTIMESTATISTICS is turned on for a connection,
<span>Derby</span> maintains information
about the execution plan for each statement executed within the connection
(except for COMMIT) until the attribute is turned off.</p>

<div class="p">For the most recently executed query, RUNTIMESTATISTICS returns information
about:  
<ul>
<li><em>The length of the compile time and the execute time</em>  
<p>This can help in benchmarking queries.</p>
</li>

<li><em>The statement execution plan</em>  
<p>This is a description of result set nodes, whether an index was used, what
the join order was, how many rows qualified at each node, and how much time was
spent in each node. This information can help you determine whether you need to
add indexes or rewrite queries.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The exact details presented, as well as the format of presentation, can
change. There are two techniques for retrieving the RUNTIMESTATISTICS
information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call <samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_RUNTIMESTATISTICS</samp>, which
retrieves the RUNTIMESTATISTICS information as formatted text.</li>

<li>Before executing your statements, call
<samp class="codeph">SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_XPLAIN_SCHEMA</samp>, which causes
<span>Derby</span> to store the
RUNTIMESTATISTICS information in the SYSXPLAIN database tables. These tables can
be queried later to retrieve the data.</li>

</ul>
