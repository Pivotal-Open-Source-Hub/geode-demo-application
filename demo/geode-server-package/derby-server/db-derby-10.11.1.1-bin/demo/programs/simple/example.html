<!-- ##########  OVERVIEW  ########## -->
<h2 class="Heading2"><a id="overview" name="overview">Overview</a>
</h2>
<p>
  This example program is a minimal JDBC application written in Java. JDBC is
  the primary API for interacting with Apache Derby using Java. This program:
</p>
<ol class="Normal">
  <li class="Normal">Runs in either embedded mode (the default) or as a client in a client/server environment, depending on the arguments passed to the program
  <li class="Normal">Starts up the Derby engine, if running in embedded mode
  <li class="Normal">Connects to the Derby Network Server, if running in client mode
  <li class="Normal">Creates and connects to a database
  <li class="Normal">Creates a table
  <li class="Normal">Inserts data
  <li class="Normal">Updates data
  <li class="Normal">Selects data
  <li class="Normal">Drops a table
  <li class="Normal">Disconnects
  <li class="Normal">Shuts down the database, if running in embedded mode
</ol>
<p>
  This program is intended to run in Virtual Machines for the Java Platform
  supporting Java SE 6 or newer.
</p>
<p>
  In embedded mode, the application starts up an instance of Derby within the
  current Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and shuts down the instance before it
  completes. No network access is involved. Only one JVM can access a database
  at a time.
</p>
<p>In a client/server environment, the application demonstrates the
use of the Derby network client driver by
connecting to the Network Server and running the demo. Note that the client
drivers allow multiple instances of the application to run at the same time.
However, the SQL operations performed by this demo will cause failures when
multiple simultaneous instances of the application are run. Use of a client
driver to connect to the Network Server in this application is intended only to
demonstrate this type of connection. The SimpleApp demo is not suited for
simultaneous executions because it creates and drops the table on which it
operates.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Note that in this document, file paths and environment variables are
  referenced using UNIX notation unless noted otherwise. This means that if, for
  example, you are using a Windows platform, you must substitute file separators,
  path separators and environment variable references to the Windows-specific
  notation, for example:</em>

<p>
  <em>Also note that this document refers to the JVM launch command as
    <var class="command">java</var>, and that it is being assumed that the JVM
    installation's launcher is available via the system's
    <em class="envVar">PATH</em>. Refer to the documentation of your JVM /
    runtime environment for details on how to run a Java program using that JVM.
    </em>
</p>
<h3>Modifying the application code</h3>
<p>
  If you decide to modify the demo application code, or use it as a model for
  your own JDBC application, be aware that any change may affect the behavior
  of the program and the results from running it.
  For example, the data verification code is very specific to the data this
  demo inserts into the database, and will not work without modification with
  other databases.
</p>
<p>
  For more information about how to use Derby, refer to the included
  documentation and the
  <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby" target="_new">Apache Derby web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you are relatively new to databases or JDBC, the
  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html" target="_new">Oracle
  JDBC basics tutorial</a> may be a good starting point.
</p>


<!-- ##########  WHAT'S INCLUDED  ########## -->
<h2 class="Heading2"><a id="included" name="included">What's Included?</a>
</h2>
<p>
  Before running this demo, you should see the following files and directories
  in the <em class="fileName">demo/programs/simple/</em> directory:
</p>
<ul class="Normal">
  <li class="Normal"><em class="fileName">example.html</em>
    <p class="BodyRelative">
      This file.
    </p>
  <li class="Normal"><em class="fileName">
    <a href="SimpleApp.java" target="_top">SimpleApp.java</a></em>
    <p class="BodyRelative">
      Source code for the example program.
      <em class="Emphasis">Examine this file to see how the application behaves
      in the various environments</em>.
    </p>
  <li class="Normal"><em class="fileName">
    <a href="derby.properties" target="_top">derby.properties</a></em>
    <p class="BodyRelative">
      Properties file for the Derby system. This demo program runs with default
      settings, but you can use this file to tune Derby if you want to.
    </p>
  <li class="Normal"><em class="fileName">SimpleApp.class</em>
    <p class="BodyRelative">
      The compiled class file, runnable by Java SE JVMs.
    </p>
</ul>

<p>
  After running the demo, you will see some new files and directories. These
  will be located in the directory that the system property
  <var class="property">derby.system.home</var>
  points to, or the current directory (<var class="property">user.dir</var>) if
  <var class="property">derby.system.home</var> is not set for the embedded or
  Network Server JVM. If you are following the instructions on this page, you
  will find the new files in the directory
  <em class="fileName">demo/programs/simple/</em>, relative to this Derby
  installation. New files are:
</p>
<ul class="Normal">
  <li class="Normal"><em class="fileName">derbyDB</em> (directory)
    <p class="BodyRelative">
      The directory that makes up the <em class="fileName">derbyDB</em> database.
      You must not modify anything in this directory, or you will corrupt the
      database. The directory was created when the application connected with
      Derby, using the attribute <em class="Emphasis">create=true</em> in the
      database connection URL. The database name, <em class="Emphasis">derbyDB</em>,
      was also set in the database connection URL.
    </p>
    <ul class="Normal">
      <li class="Normal"><em class="fileName">derbyDB/log</em> (directory)
        <p class="BodyRelative">
          The directory that holds the database transaction logs for the
          <em class="fileName">derbyDB</em> database.
        </p>
      <li class="Normal"><em class="fileName">derbyDB/seg0</em> (directory)
        <p class="BodyRelative">
          The directory that holds the data for the <em class="fileName">derbyDB</em>
          database.
        </p>
      <li class="Normal"><em class="fileName">derbyDB/service.properties</em>
        <p class="BodyRelative">
          An internal file that holds boot-time configuration parameters for the
          <em class="fileName">derbyDB</em> database; do not edit.
        </p>
    </ul>
   <li class="Normal"><em class="fileName">derby.log</em>
    <p class="BodyRelative">
      The log file with Derby progress and error messages.
    </p>
</ul>
<p>
  To remove the effects of running the demo program, simply delete the database
  directory (<em class="fileName">derbyDB</em>) and
  <em class="fileName">derby.log</em>. Note that if you are running the demo in
  a client/server environment you most likely need to shut down the Derby
  Network Server before being able to delete the database directory.

<!-- ##########  HOW TO RUN - EMBEDDED  ########## -->
<h2 class="Heading2"><a id="runembedded" name="runembedded">How to run this sample application in an embedded environment</a>
</h2>
<p>
  The Derby embedded driver is a JDBC driver included in binary distributions of
  Apache Derby, in the directory <em class="fileName">$DERBY_HOME/lib/</em>.
  The embedded driver should be used when you want to run Derby in the same
  JVM as your application, for example when no direct network access to the
  database system is needed.

  this environment variable will be used later on this page to refer to the
  required Derby resources, files, etc. Examples:
    <p class="BodyRelative">UNIX (ksh/bash)</p>

  and Derby's embedded driver library (<em class="fileName">derby.jar</em>).
  (You may skip this step and provide the classpath as an option to the JVM
  launch command instead, refer to your JVM's documentation for details).
    <p class="BodyRelative">This may be done as follows:</p>
    <p class="BodyRelative">UNIX (ksh/bash):</p>
    <p class="commandLine">export CLASSPATH=.:${DERBY_HOME}/lib/derby.jar</p>
