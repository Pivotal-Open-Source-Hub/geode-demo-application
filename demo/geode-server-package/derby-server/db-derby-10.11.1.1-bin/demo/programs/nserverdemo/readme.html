<H1>Overview</H1>
<p>The following example scenarios show you how to obtain an <em class="Emphasis">embedded connection</em> and <em class="Emphasis">client connections</em> using the Network Server to connect to the same database.</p>

<p>An embedded connection is a connection to a database that is booted in the same JVM as the application. The URL prefix is jdbc:derby:</p>

<p>Client applications that require a database connection across the network use the network server protocol (DRDA) to connect to the Network Server. This type of connection is referred to as a client connection. The URL prefix is jdbc:derby:net:</p>

	<p class="BodyRelative">This example uses two programs to illustrate how a typical client program that starts up in its own JVM can connect to the Network Server that the server program starts. The client program (SimpleNetworkClientSample) and the server program (SimpleNetworkServerSample) each run in their own (different) JVMs. The example shows the Derby jar files that are needed at the client side and server side to use the Network Server. The SimpleNetworkClientSample program also shows how to use the DriverManager or a DataSource to obtain client connections.</p></LI></LI>

	<p class="BodyRelative">This example program (NsSample) starts the network server and shows how to obtain client and embedded connections using the Network Server to connect to the same database, all in one JVM.</p></LI></LI>
