<H1>The Getting Started With Derby Sample Programs</H1>
<P>The programs in this directory are described in the the 
<A href="../../../docs/html/getstart/index.html"><i>Getting Started With Derby</i></A>
manual. Please see this document for more information.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <p class="BodyRelative">
  <A href="WwdEmbedded.java" type="text/plain"><code>WwdEmbedded.java</code></A></p>
  <p class="BodyRelative">A very basic JDBC program that uses Derby. This is 
  the primary program example used in the JDBC sections of <i>Getting Started With
  Derby</i>. It is described in detail in that manual.</p>
  </LI>
  <LI><p class="BodyRelative">
  <A href="WwdClientExample.java" type="text/plain"><code>WwdClientExample.java</code></A></p>
  <p class="BodyRelative">This is an example of what the <code>WwdClient.java</code> program created as part
  of one of the <i>Getting Started With Derby</i> activities will look like. A working copy of that code
  is provided here for people interested in examining the code without performing
  the edits described in the activity.</p></LI>

  <LI><p class="BodyRelative"><A href="WwdUtils.java" type="text/plain"><code>WwdUtils.java</code></A></p>
<P class="BodyRelative">These are utility methods used by the <i>Getting Started With Derby</i> programs that
are not described in the manual. The processing performed by these methods
does not demonstrate basic JDBC processing and so is outside the scope
of an introductory manual like <i>Getting Started With Derby</i>. These methods provide
environment validation and manage user input so the program is more robust.
The code is provided here for people interested in examining the processing.
It contains three methods:</P>
<OL>
  <LI><code>getWishItem</code> - Prompts for user input and returns the entered text, if any,
  to the calling program. Handles I/O exceptions and insists that some text
  is entered.
  <LI><code>wwdChk4Table</code> - Checks if the table needed by the program already exists
  and is defined properly. Handles certain errors that could occur.
  <LI><code>main</code> - Allows standalone testing of the
  <code>getWishItem</code> method.
</OL></LI>
